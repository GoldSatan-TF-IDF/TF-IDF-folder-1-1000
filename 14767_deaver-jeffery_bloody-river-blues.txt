jeffery deaver bloody river blues the second book in the john pellam series writing as william jefferies for monica derham all you need for a movie is a gun and a girl jeanluc godard one all he wanted was a case of beer and it looked like he was going to have to get it himself the way stile explained it i cant hardly get a case of labatts on the back of a yamaha thats okay pellam said into the cellular phone you want a sixpack i can handle that but the racks a little loose which i guess i owe you the rack i mean sorry the motorcycle was the film companys but had been issued to pellam who had in turn loaned it to stile stile was a stuntman pellam chose not to speculate on what he had been doing when the rack got broken thats okay pellam said again ill pick up a case he hung up the phone he got his brown bomber jacket from the front closet of the winnebago trying to remember where hed seen the discount beverage store the riverfront deli was not far away but the date of his next expense check was and pellam did not feel inclined to pay for a case even if it had been imported all the way from canada he stepped into the kitchenette of the camper stirred the chili and put the cornbread in the small oven to heat he had thought about cooking something else for a change nobody seemed to notice that whenever pellam hosted the poker game he made chili maybe he would serve it on hot dogs maybe on rice but it was always chili and oyster crackers he didnt know how to cook much else he thought about doing without the beer calling back stile and saying yeah just bring a sixpack but he did the calculation and decided they needed a whole case there would be five of them playing for six hours and that meant even a case would be stretched pretty thin he would have to break out the mezcal and wild turkey as it was pellam stepped outside locked the camper door and walked along the road paralleling the gray plane of the missouri river it was just after dark an autumn weekday and by rights ought to be rush hour but the road dipped and rose away from him and it was deserted of traffic he zipped his jacket tight pellam was tall and thin tonight he wore jeans and a work shirt that had been black and was now mottled gray his cowboy boots sounded in loud scraping taps on the wet asphalt he wished he had worn his lakers cap or his stetson a cold wind saltyfishy smelling streamed off the river his eyes stung his ears ached he walked quickly he was worried that dannythe scriptwriter of the movie they were now shooting would show up early pellam had recently left a tenpound catfish in dannys hotel room bathtub and the writer had threatened to weld the winnebago door shut in retaliation the fourth of the poker players was a grip from san diego who looked just like the merchant marine he had once been complete with tattoo the fifth was a lawyer in st louis a hawkish man with jowls the film companys la office had hired him to negotiate property and talent contracts with the locals he talked nonstop about washington politics as if he had run for office and been defeated because he was the only honest candidate in the race his chatter was a pain but he was a hell of a good man to play poker with he bet big and lost amiably hands in pockets pellam turned down adams street away from the river studying the spooky abandoned redbrick maddox ironworks building thinking its damp it may rain thinking would the filming in this damn town go much over schedule would the chili burn had he turned it down thinking about a case of beer all right gaudia is walking down third okay he works most of the time till six or sixthirty but tonight hes going for drinks with some girl i dont know who she is philip lombro asked ralph bales why is he in maddox thats what im saying hes going to the jolly rogue for drinks you know it then hes going to callaghans for the steak as he listened philip lombro dipped his head and touched his cheek with two fingers formed into a v he had a long face tanned the color though didnt turn lombro bronze he was more silvery like platinum which matched his mane of white hair carefully sprayed into place he said what about gaudias bodyguard he wont be coming gaudia thinks maddox is safe okay then hes got a reservation at seventhirty its a fiveminute walki timed itand theyll leave at quarter after ralph bales was sitting forward on the front seat of the navyblue lincoln as he spoke to lombro ralph bales was thirtynine muscular hairy everywhere but on the head his face was disproportionately thick as if he were wearing a latex specialeffects mask he was not an ugly man but seen straight on his face because of the fat seemed moonlike tonight he wore a blackandred striped rugby shirt blue jeans and a leather jacket hes on third okay theres an alleyway there going west its real dark steviell be there doing kind of a homeless number homeless they dont have homeless in maddox well a bum theyve got bums in maddox ralph bales said okay hes got a little beretta a doesnt even need a suppressor ive got the ruger stevie calls him he stops and turns stevie does him up close im behind just in case bang were in stevies car over the river then were lost ill be in front of the alley then lombro said on third ralph bales didnt say anything for a moment but kept his eyes on lombro what he saw was this a hook nose kind eyes trim suit paisley tie it was odd but you couldnt see more than that you thought you could peg him easily as if the silver hair the tasseled oxblood loafers polished spitshine and the battered rolex were going to explain everything about philip lombro but no those were all you could come up with the parts and the parts alone like a people magazine photo lombro who was calmly looking back into ralph baless eyes said yes do you have a problem with that ralph bales decided he could win the staring contest if he wanted to and began to examine the swirl of hair on the back of his own hand okay i dont think its such a good idea you being there but i told you that already yes you did okay i still dont think its a good idea i want to see him die youll see pictures the postdispatchllhave pictures the reporterllhave pictures in color ill be there from sevenfifteen ralph bales was drumming his fingers on the leather seat of the lincoln its my ass too lombro looked at his watch the crystal was chipped and yellowed sixfifty i can find somebody else to do the job ralph bales waited a moment that wont be necessary you want to be there thats your business yes it is my business without response ralph bales swung the car door open thats when it happened sonofabitch a thud the sound of glass on glass a couple of muted pops ralph bales saw the mana thin guy in a brown leather jacketstanding there looking down a sour smile on his face a smile that said iknew something like this was going to happen foamy beer chugged out of the bottom of the cardboard case which rested on its end on the sidewalk the man looked at ralph bales then past him into the car ralph bales slammed the door and walked away the man with the rueful grin said hey my beer ralph bales ignored him and continued along adams hey my beer ralph bales ignored him the man was stepping toward him im talking to you hey ralph bales said fuck you and turned the corner the tall man stood staring after him for a moment his mouth twisted and indignant then bent down and looked into the window of the lincoln he cupped his hands he tapped on the window hey your buddy hey he rapped again lombro put the car in gear it pulled away quickly the man jumped back he watched the lincoln vanish he knelt down to his wounded carton which was pumping beer into the gutter like a leaky fire hydrant maddox police department patrolman first class donald buffett watched the last of the beer trickle into the street thinking that if that had happened in the cabrini projects on the west side of town youd have a dozen guys lapping it out of the gutter or knifing each other over the unbroken bottles buffett leaned against a brick wall and watched the guybuffett thought he looked like a cowboyopen up the case and salvage what he could like a kid picking through his toys the cowboy stood up and counted what looked to be maybe twelve fifteen surviving bottles the cardboard box was soaked and disintegrating buffett had expected him to take a swing at the man who stepped out of the lincoln there was a time before the service before the academy when going for skin was what buffett himself would have done he watched the cowboy lining up all the good bottles in the shadow of a neuman furniture warehouse hiding them he must have been planning to go back to the store he dumped the box in the trash and wiped his hands on his pants buffett pushed off from the wall and walked across the street evening sir he said the cowboy looked up shaking his head he said you see that you believe it buffett said ill keep an eye on them you want to get a bag or something yeah sure thanks he disappeared down the empty street ten minutes later the cowboy returned carrying a plastic shopping bag which held two sixpacks he also carried a small paper bag which he handed to buffett id offer you a labatts but they probably got rules about you being on duty so its a coffee and doughnut a couple sugars in the bag thank you sir buffett said formally feeling embarrassed and wondering why he did didnt have to the cowboy started to pick up the beers and loaded them in the shopping bag buffet did not offer to help finally the cowboy stood up and said john pellam donnie buffett they nodded and didnt shake hands buffett lifted the coffee into the air like a toast and walked off listening to beer bottles clink as the man headed toward the river at seventwenty that evening vincent gaudia looked down the lowcut white dress of his blond companion and told her its time to eat what did you have in mind she asked breathily smiling tiny crowsfeet into the makeup that was laid on a few microns too deep gaudia was addicted to women like this although he viewed them as a commodity he tried not to be condescending some of his dates were very intelligent some were spiritual some spent many hours volunteering for good causes and though he did not pursue them for their minds or souls or consciences he listened avidly as they spoke about their interests and he did so with genuine curiosity on the other hand what he wanted most from this girl was to take her to his coop where he would tell her to shut the hell up about spirit guides and climb onto her hands and knees then lift her garter belt with his hands and tug on it like reins he now eased a strategically placed elbow against her breasts and said for the moment im talking about dinner she giggled they left the jolly rogue then crossed river road and walked up third street toward downtown maddox past foreboding warehouses storefronts filled with blotched and decaying used furniture groundfloor offices dingy coffee shops the woman squeezed closer to him against the cold the chill air reminded gaudia of his boyhood in cape girardeau when he would walk home from school shuffling leaves in front of his saddle shoes working on a toffee apple or halloween candy he had pulled some crazy stunts at halloween and he could not smell cold fall air without being stirred by good memories gaudia asked whatd you do on halloween when you were a kid she blinked then concentrated on her answer well we had a lot of fun you know i used to dress up mostly like princesses and things like that i was a witch one year a witch no way you couldnt be one if you tried sweetheart and then wed go for tons of candy i mean like tons i liked babe ruths no ha ha baby ruths best and what id do sometimes is find a house that was giving them out and keep going back there one halloween i got twelve baby ruths i had to be careful i had a lot of zits when i was a kid kids dont go much anymore its dangerous did you hear about that guy who put needles in apples i never liked apples i only liked candy bars baby ruths gaudia remembered wherere we going this is a creepy neighborhood this is a creepy town but its got the best steak house in the state outside of kansas city callaghans you like steak yeah i like steak i like surf and turf she added demurely but its expensive i think theyve got surf and turf there you want surf and turf order it what you want you can have ralph bales stood on the street corner in the alcove of missouri national bank watching the couple stroll under a dim streetlight three of the four bulbs burnt out the girl was glued on to his arm which probably was more a plus than anything because if gaudia was carrying a weapon shed tie up his shooting hand philip lombros dark lincoln town car boxy as an aircraft carrier exhaust purring sat across the street ralph bales studied the perfect bodywork the immaculate chrome then he looked at the silhouette of lombro behind the wheel that man was crazy ralph bales could not understand his wanting to watch it watching the act of the shooting itself he knew some guys who got off on doing people got off on it in some scary sex way he sensed though that this was something lombro felt he had to do not something he wanted to do a voice fluttered over the cool airstevie flom ralph baless partner was doing his schizoid homeless routine theres what it is i mean theres it i read the papers i read the papers i read them forget what you read forget what you read then ralph bales thought he heard stevie pull the slide on the beretta though that might have been his imagination at moments like this you heard noises you saw things that were otherwise silent or invisible his nerves shook like a dragster waiting for the green light he wished he didnt get so nervous tapping leather soles on concrete the sound seemed very loud tapping and scuffing along the wet deserted sidewalk giggling tapping light glinted off gaudias feet ralph bales knew gaudias reputation for fashion and figured he would be wearing fivehundreddollar shoes ralph baless shoes were stamped manmade uppers and the men who had made those uppers had been taiwanese the footsteps twenty feet away the murmur of the lincolns exhaust the beating of ralph baless heart stevie talking like a crazy drunk arguing with himself the blonde giggling then stevie said a quarter mister please and son of a bitch if gaudia wasnt stopping and stepping forward with a bill ralph bales started across the street holding the ruger a huge gun barrelheavy in his hand then the womans shrill scream and a swing of motion a blur as gaudia swung her around as a shield putting her between him and stevies one pop then two the blonde slumped gaudia was running fast getting away christonthecross ralph bales lifted the heavy gun and fired twice he hit gaudia at least once he thought it was in the lower neck the man stumbled onto the sidewalk lifted a hand briefly then lay still lombros lincoln started away accelerating with a sharp gassy roar silence for a moment ralph bales took a step toward gaudia freeze the scream came from only five feet away bales almost vomited in shock and the way his heart surged he wondered if he was having a heart attack i mean you mister ralph baless hand lowered the gun pointed down his breath flowed in and out in staccato bursts he swallowed drop the weapon the voice crackled with a barely controlled hysteria im dropping it ralph bales did he squinted as the gun fell it didnt go off lie down on the ground the cop was crouching holding his gun aimed straight at ralph baless head okay ralph bales said dont do anything im lying down now im doing it now im lying down now ralph bales got on his knees then lay forward on his stomach he smelled grease and dog piss the cop circled around him lacking the ruger away and talking into his walkietalkie thiss buffett im in downtown maddox ive got a shots fired and two down need an ambulance and backup at the maddox police and fire central radio dispatcher did not find out exactly where donnie buffett needed the backup and ambulanceat least not at that moment the cops message ended abruptly when stevie flom stepped out of the alleyway and emptied the clip of the beretta into his back buffett grunted dropped to his knees and tried to reach behind him he fell forward ralph bales climbed to his feet picked up the ruger he walked over to the unconscious cop and pointed the big gun at his head he cocked it slowly the heavy blue muzzle nestled itself in the cops damp hair ralph bales covered his eyes with his left hand his heart beat eight times his hand tensed it relaxed he stepped back and turned away from the cop settling on one head shot for gaudia and one for the blonde then as if they were a couple of basketball fans eager for some beers after the game ralph bales and stevie flom walked briskly to a stolen black trans am with a sporty red racing stripe on the side stevie fired up the engine ralph bales sat down in the comfortable bucket seat he lifted his blunt index finger to his upper lip and smelled sour gunpowder and primer smoke as they drove slowly to the river ralph bales watched the aura of lights rising up from st louis to the south thinking that all he would have to do now was take care of the witnessthe guy with the beerand that would be that two yellow light fading in and out going to black black to yellow motion shouting more blackness deep deep pain cant breathe cant swallow the fragments of yellow light there they go slipping away dont leave dont leave me donnie buffett focused for a moment on pennys terrified face pale and framed with dark hair the sight of her terror terrified him he reached for her hand he passed out when he opened his eyes again his wife was gone and the room was dark he had never been so exhausted or so thirsty after a few minutes he began to understand that he had been shot and the instant he thought that he forgot everythingpenny the sickening loose feelings in his back and guts his thirstand he concentrated on trying to remember something one word a short word the one word that gave purpose to his entire life the word what is the word he slipped back into unconsciousness when he woke again he saw a filipino nurse water he whispered rinse and spit she said thirsty rinse and spit she squirted water into his mouth from a plastic bottle dont swallow he swallowed he vomited the nurse sighed loudly and cleaned him i cant feel my legs did they cut my legs off no youre tired oh the word what the hell was it please dear mother of our lord let me remember he fell asleep trying to remember the word and when he awoke a short time later he was still trying to remember it sitting across from him were two men in rumpled suits when he looked at them he smiled hey hes smiling the man who said this was blond and squarejawed yo donnie the other man said i wont ask how youre doing cause your answers gonna be what a dumbass question i feel like shit he was darkcomplected with short slick hair he looked at buffett with real affection he gripped buffetts hand warmly they got me from behind there was another one behind me bob gianno the darkcomplected detective continued the mayors coming down to see you he wants to wish you luck luck why do i need luck ive been lucky i dont need luck what i need is to get out of this bed buffetts lips were rising and falling whats that richard hagedorn the blond detective leaned forward why cant i he shook his head and said indignantly i had my body armor on he got you below it thats what they said at the press conference oh press conference there was a press conference about me gianno said we met your wife donnie shes really pretty buffett nodded blankly the detective continued guess you know why were here what can you tell us about the hit the periphery faded fast dissolving again into a million black dots yellow light white light his organs seemed to shift floating he felt deep pain that was all the more terrifying because it did not seem to hurt he tried to remember the word the word the word the answer lies in the word i his voice ended in a rasp he inhaled hard maybe we should hagedorn began but buffett wiped sweat away from his face with the blanket and said all i saw was one perp cauc balding dark hair back was to me i didnt make the face thirtyfive maybe a pause the air hissed in over the dry tissue of his mouth and burned like alcohol on a cut make him five ten eleven weighed one ninety wearing a dark jacket shirt jeans i think i dont remember had a big gun a fortyfour buffett said slowly the other one the one shot me you make him at all buffett shook his head no then asked who was the hit vince gaudia and some squeeze man buffett whispered reverently gaudia he closed his eyes and shook his head petersons gonna be pissing red hagedorn said hell with peterson were gonna get the scumbag that did you donnie buffett said i didnt see the third one either third one hagedorn asked he and gianno exchanged glances the guy in the lincoln what lincoln gianno was taking notes dark lincoln it was parked across the street i didnt get tag numbers or make buffett coughed i want some water hagedorn went into the john and got a glass he handed it to buffett who hesitated then said i might puke gianno said i seen worse than cops barfing buffett didnt puke though and he handed the empty glass back to hagedorn with triumph best thing i ever had in my mouth the men laughed there was no need to say aloud any of the three punch lines that materialized simultaneously in three different minds gianno asked the guy in the lincoln was he getaway no he drove off by himself maybe it was somebody who had to id the hit naw gianno said everybody knows what gaudia looks like hes a cover boy well looked like buffett said well maybe it was the guy who hired baldy some big fish i wonder donnie you got any idea who was inside no but i saw a guy who did theres a witness buffett told them about the beer incident this guy was talking to the driver saying something fantastic hagedorn smiled gianno turned to a blank page in his notebook whats he look like buffett was about to give them a description and thats what did it the word came back to him the magic word buffett beamed he whispered pellam tell him gianno asked and looked at hagedorn with a frown his names pellam the smile on buffetts face glistened and grew you got his name gianno nodded enthusiastically he live around there dunno buffett shrugged which sent a stab of pain through his neck he remained very still for a moment frozen as the pain slowly receded well find him gianno said reverently the smile slipped off buffett s face as he tried to shift his leg and found he was unable to the sheet he guessed was rucked in too tightly he absently pulled at the bedclothes and smacked his thigh gotta get the circulation going ive been on my butt too long were gonna go find this guy donnie gianno slapped his notebook shut one thing buffett said you know witnesses when its a hit like this hes gonna get amnesia bet you any money gianno snorted oh hell talk donnie dont you worry about that apparently some trouble with the chili the beer and whiskey were gone completely but the whole pot of chili was pretty much untouched danny and stile remained behind in the camper after the other poker players had left and they helped pellam clean up danny with his thick nose twentynineyearolds smooth complexion and shoulderlength black hair resembled a navajo warrior whatd you do to the chili danny said to pellam crinkling his nose then emptied some ashtrays into a trash bag although he often said blunt things to people they rarely took offense the chili stile slipped labatts bottles into another bag and twirled his bushy mustache although pellam was descendedso the family story wentfrom a real gunslinger pellam thought stile was a dead ringer for the ancestor in question wild bill hickok stile was lanky and had a droopy vietnam vet mustache the shade of his dark blond hair he reflected i remember this western i worked on one time i forget whose i was falling off a cliff i think it was an eightyfoot cliff and the compressor broke so they couldnt inflate the air bag as much as the unit director wanted to hm pellam muttered and stepped into the kitchenette to look at the chili hed eaten two bowls piled with onions and slices of american cheese seemed okay to him no stile reflected it was a hundredandthirtyfoot cliff bored again danny said got the point an oscarnominated scriptwriter danny sat in deluxe hotel suites in front of an nec laptop computer and wrote scenes that sent people like stile off hundredandthirtyfoot cliffs he was not impressed stile man there we were in the middle of this desert in a very native american frame of mind you know what im saying whats wrong with the chili pellam tried another spoonful yup burned it reminded him of scotch the smokiness but there wasnt anything wrong with it it could have been intended as if he had tried a new recipe if it tasted like mesquite for instance nobody would have said anything except maybe damn good chili pellam he piled dishes in the tiny sink rinsed some of them in the dribble of the water from the faucet anyway when i landed i went down so far my belt loops made an impression in the mud beneath the bag uh that happens sometimes danny said lethargically to air out the camper pellam opened the front door chili smoke was only part of it the lawyer from st louis had been lighting one cigarette after another pellam had noticed that midwesterners did not seem to know this habit was bad for you danny and stile argued about who had the riskier jobstile falling off high cliffs or danny having to pitch his stories to producers and development people stile said that was an old joke and tried to convince danny to go basejumping with him sometime to live and die in la stile whispered reverently awesome scene the jump from the bridge pellam still at the front door squinted he saw a large boxy shadow in the grass not far from where the camper was parked what was it he squinted which didnt help he remembered seeing that area in the daylightit was a field full of crabgrass and weeds what would be sitting in the middle of a lousy field this time of night funny the shadow looked just like the shadow began to murmur a car it accelerated fast spraying dirt and stones nosing quickly out of the grass grinding the undercarriage as it went over the sharp drop to the highway probably lovers pellam thought necking he could not remember the last time he necked did people still do it probably in the midwest they did pellam lived in los angeles and nobody hed ever dated there necked it was only when he turned back to the camper that he realized that the car had not turned on its lights until it was far down river road because of this the license plate was not illuminated until it was too far away to be read odd wish id seen it danny said emphatically was just a car pellam muttered glancing toward the disappearing taillights the other two stared at him i meant danny said the base jump off that bridge oh danny thanked pellam for the game and the company but not the chili after he left stile stepped into the kitchenette and began doing the dishes you dont have to not a problem he washed everything but the chili pot man blackbottom chili youre on your own there buddy i got diverted on my way back from the store stile asked how long you in this hellhole of a town for till shootings done tonys reshooting every other scene he does that yup well if were here next week come over to the quality inn for a game ive got a hotplate there and ill whip up philly cheese steaks with onions by the by im getting the hertz tomorrow you can have your bike back then stile had been in town three weeks and had already burned out the transmission of his rental car rental companies should ask for occupation and not rent their vehicles to stuntmen pellam walked him to the door when you got here dyou see a car parked over there where there thats just a mess of weeds pellam whyd anybody park there stile stepped outside inhaled the air he whistled a stevie wonder tune through his gunslinger mustache as he walked in long strides to the battered yamaha with the rack dangling precariously from the back fender was it him i couldnt tell he get a look at the car if i couldnt tell it was him how could i tell if he got a look at the car and if you cracked that transmission case boy youre paying for it you hear me ralph bales was speaking to stevie flom they had abandoned the pontiac and were in ralph baless cadillac stevie driving flom was twentyfive years old he was north italian blond and had gorgeous muscles and babysmooth skin his round face had never once been disfigured by a pimple he had slept with women he was a cargo handler on the riverfront though he took a lot of sick days and for real money he ran numbers and did odd jobs for men who had the sort of odd jobs few people were willing to do he was married and had three girlfriends he made about sixty thousand a year and lost about thirty thousand of it in reno and at poker games in east st louis and memphis drive ralph bales instructed looking back at the camper its like he was looking at us well was he what looking at us just drive the night was cloudless off to their left the big plain of the missouri river was moving slowly southeastward the same water that had looked so muddy and black yesterday when he was planning the hit tonight looked goldenlit by the security floods of a small factory on the south shore ralph bales had thought that locating the witness would be easy just find the store where hed bought the beer and trace him from there but hed forgotten he was in maddox missouri where there was not much for the locals to do except be out of work and drink all day or do muscle labor for maddox riverfront services or stoop labor for farmers and drink all night ralph bales checking the yellow pages found two dozen package good stores within walking distance of where hed collided with the witness as he climbed from lombros car so theyd ditched the trans am sent the ruger to sleep forty feet below the choppy surface of the missouri and sped home to change clothes then returned here in ralph bales s own car he had shaved off the mustache donned fake glasses a rumpled irish tweed cap a pressed blue shirt open at the neck and a herringbone sport jacket pretending to be an insurance company lawyer representing the cop whod been shot he walked from store to store until he finally found a clerk who remembered selling a case of beer to a thin man in a bomber jacket at around seven that evening he said hes got a camper parked over at bideawee its that what is it ralph bales asked you know that trailer park by the concrete plant one thing the clerk had warned solemnly dont ask him for a part in the film he dont take to that film ralph bales and stevie had then cruised down to the river and parked in the weedy lot outside bells bideawee they could look through the campers small windows but ralph bales had not been able to see clearly if it was the beer man or not then the door had opened and stevie had gotten it into his head that he was calling in a description of the car to the cops and had burned out of there ralph bales shouting be careful with the transmission case and stevie flom not paying any attention they now cruised through the night at fiftyfive mph even away from maddox tomorrow morning lets pay him a visit but maybe hell give the cops a description of you tonight ralph bales considered this he shook his head he doesnt even know about the hit christ he had a party going on in there a guys a witness to a hit he isnt going to have a party i mean wouldnt you think stevie said he guessed and put on a metallica tape at seven the next morning they started with the sledgehammers on the winnebago door the interrupted dream was about oldfashioned cars driving slowly in circles around a movie set someone kept asking pellam if he wanted a ride and he did but whoever asked didnt stop long enough to let him get in the car pellam had grown very bored waiting for a car to pick him up it wasnt a great dream but at least he was asleep when he was having it and when the sledgehammers started he became awake pellam sat up and swung his feet over the edge of the bunk in the back of the camper he found his watch pellam had often been up at seven but he had rarely wakened at that hour there was a big difference between the two the hammers pounded he stood up and pulled on his jeans and a black tshirt he looked in the mirror hed slept in one position all nighton his stomach like a babyand his black hair had gone spiky pellam smoothed it and rubbed at the welts that the crumpled sheet had left across his face he went to see who was swinging hammers hey dude stile said walking into the kitchen past him i was sent to collect you pellam put a kettle on stile stood beside the campers tiny dining table still covered with cards and pellams meager winnings he looked at the chili pot and tapped the black crust with his fingernail he foraged in the miniature refrigerator you got zero food in here why are you here pellam mumbled your phone its not turned on stile found an old bagel and broke it in half he lifted the other half toward pellam who shook his head and dropped two spoonfuls of instant coffee into a styrofoam cup coffee he asked stile naw i got my wheels you can have the cycle back its in the trunk theres a little teeny dent on the fender otherwise its in perfect condition well its muddy well the rack too pellam poured water into the cup and sat heavily on the bench stile told him his hair was all spiky what are you doing here pellam asked again as he smoothed his hair tony needs you hes like apoplecticis that the right wordand you shut your phone off because i wanted to sleep later than seven oclock i been up for an hour stile did tai chi at dawn he ate the bagel thoughtfully you know john i got to admit i was a little curious why youre working for tony pellam took three sips of scalding coffee that was something about instant it tasted terrible but it started hot and stayed hot he rubbed his thumb and index finger together designating money in answer to stiles question about tony stiles grunt equaled a shrug as if he suspected there was more to it on the other hand stile was a senior union stuntman and even at the screen actors guilds contract minimums would be well paid but he was also a standin for one of the leads and because of this and because of his experience his agent had negotiated an overscale contract he understood all about the motives for being attached to a bigbudget project well herr eisenstein has summoned you and im delivering the word he finished the bagel he tell you whats up he wants to blow up an oil refinery for the final scene what pellam rubbed his eyes i swear to god hes going to build this mockup of an old dc and tow it behind a chopper then stile mimicked a plane diving into the stove kaboom pellam shook his head hes out of you son of a bitch you eat a mans last bagel and you rag him all the while youre doing it and here it is not even dawn stile laughed damn easy to pull your chain pellam up and at em rise and shine our master calls bells bideawee contained two tents the winnebago which was parked in the row closest to the road and a ford taurus from whose trunk a yellow motorcycle protruded the camper was surrounded by unoccupied spaces dotted with short galvanized steel pipes and junction boxes for utility hookups that stretched away toward the river like slots in a miniature drivein movie theater stevie flom had turned off river road and driven a half block through a stretch of boardedup oneand twostory houses and stores he had started to park noseout in an alley between two deserted shops ralph bales had told him not to get fancyjust parallel park on the street and read the paper or somethingonly leave the engine running ralph bales walked down to river road it was morning but he saw lights on in the camper then he saw a mans silhouette walking around inside ralph bales stepped into a phone booth whose floor was covered with the tiny blue cubes from its four shattered windows three tall weeds grew up through this pile he picked up the receiver with a kleenex and pretended to talk while he studied the camper he looked beyond the winnebago to the river this morning it looked different stillnot silvergray not the golden shade of last night now the surface had a rusty sheen to it mirroring a redness in the sky that came ralph bales believed from garbage pumped into the air by refineries outside of wood river across the mississippi the wind was steady and it bent grass and weeds on the riverbank but hardly lifted any ripples from the ruddy water which plodded southward ralph bales remembered a song that he hadnt thought of for years a soundtrack song from twentyfive years ago the byrds closing number in easy rider he heard the music in his head clearly but could not recall the lyrics just snatches of words about a man wanting to be free about a river flowing away from someplace flowing to the sea the door to the camper opened yep it was him the beer man the witness he was followed by a tall gangly man with a droopy mustache together they stepped to the back of the taurus and wrestled the motorcycle out of the trunk the colt appeared from under ralph baless coat and he looked around him slowly a mile away a semi downshifted with a silent belch of smoke a flock of gray birds dotted past in the middle of the muddy river a scarred and patchy tug fought its way upstream the two men were talking standing together over the cycle the mustached man pointed to what looked like a dent in the mudguard then he jiggled the chrome rack the beer man shrugged then wheeled the motorcycle toward the road ralph bales was waiting for the friend to get in the taurus and leave but then decided he should kill both of them he lifted his colt and rested the square notch of the sight on the beer mans chest the silver truck approached he lowered the gun it roared past engulfing the men in a swirl of papers and dust ralph bales lifted the gun once more the road was empty now no trucks or cars nothing between him and his targets thirty feet away from the phone booth and its floor of shattered glass three he climbed onto the battered muddy yellow motorcycle and fired it up then gunned the engine several times pulling on a black helmet he popped the clutch suddenly and did a wheelie scooting a precarious ten feet before the front tire descended again to the street he skidded to a braking stop and returned to his mustached friend ralph bales steadied the gun with his left palm and began to apply the nine pounds of pressure required to release the hammer the beer man pulled on darkframed sunglasses and zipped up his jacketfor one slow moment he sat up completely straight perpendicular to ralph bales offering a target that was impossible to miss at this moment ralph bales lowered the gun he squinted watching the man sit forward and tap the bike into first gear with his toe it skidded away on river road with a ragged chainsaw roar of the punchy engine his friend shouted at him and shook his fist then leapt into the taurus and with a huge spume of dust and gravel roared over the curb and chased the cycle down river road laying down thick tire marks ralph bales eased the hammer down onto an empty cylinder and slipped the gun into his pocket he looked up and down the road then turned jogging back into the murky shadows of the riverfront streets he walked up to the cadillac he rapped on the drivers window jesus i didnt hear it stevie shouted tossing the paper in the backseat the sheets separating and filling the car he flipped the car into gear i didnt hear the shot man he glanced through the rear window i didnt hear it ralph bales casually flicked his fingers toward stevie lets go the young man shouted again what do you mean what are you doing move over ralph bales mouthed what stevie shouted ill drive stevie looked back again as if a dozen missouri highway patrol cars were racing after him ralph bales said put it in park what put the car in park and move over he responded with exasperation ill drive he climbed in and signaled and made a careful slow utum what happened have to wait you didnt do it excuse me ralph bales asked with mock astonishment you just said you didnt hear any shots man scared the living crap out of me i mean bang bang bang on the window i thought you were a cop what the hell happened ralph bales didnt answer for a moment there were a bunch of people around there were they now drove past the deserted campground stevie protested i dont see anybody you wanted me to do it right in front of a dozen witnesses stevie swiveled around what was it like a bus drove past or something yeah it was like a bus samuel clemens once stayed in the town of maddox missouri and supposedly wrote part of tom sawyer here the maddox historical society implied that the caverns outside of town were the true inspiration for injun joes cave despite evidenceand the assertion of a more credible tourist board hannibal missourito the contrary other claims to fame were pretty sparse in william jennings bryan gave a speech here standing on a real soapbox to do so and maddox was cited by fdr in a fireside chat as an example of towns decimated by the depression one of the now defunct metalwork mills in town had thedistinction of fabricating part of the housing used in what would have been the third atomic bomb dropped in world war ii but these honors aside maddox was essentially a stillborn detroit unlike jefferson city which sat genteel and majestic on gnarled stone bluffs above the missouri maddox squatted on the rivers muddy banks just north of where the wide water was swallowed by the wider mississippi no malls no downtown rehab no landscaped condos maddox was now a town of about thirty thousand the downtown was a gloomy array of pre retail stores and twostory office buildings none of which was fully occupied outside of this grim core were two or three dozen factories about half of them still working at varying degrees of capacity unemployment was at percent the towns per capita income was among the lowest in missouri and alcoholism and crime were at record highs the city was continually in and out of insolvency and the one fire company in town sometimes had to make heartbreaking decisions about which of two or three simultaneous blazes it was going to fight residents lived in decrepit housing projects and minuscule nineteenthcentury bungalows hemmed in by neighbors and uncut grass and kudzu amid yards decorated with doorless refrigerators rusted tricycles cardboard boxes on every block were scorched circles like primitive sacrifice sites where trashwhose collection the city was often unable to undertakewas illegally burned maddox missouri was a dark river beside the darker rust of storage tanks maddox was rats nosing boldly over greasy indestructible us centennial cobblestones maddox was wiry grass pushing through rotting wooden loading docks and bb craters in plate glass and collapsed grain elevators maddox was no more or less than what you saw just beyond the welcome to sign on river road the skeleton of a rustedout chevy oneton pickup not worth selling for scrap but for john pellam maddox was heaven a month earlier he had just finished scouting locations in montana he had been sitting outside of the winnebago his brown nokonas stretched out in front of him and pointing more or less at the spot where george armstrong ousters ego finally caught up with him pellam had been drinking beer when his cellular phone had started buzzing he hadnt more than answered it before the speaker was barraging him with a story about two young lovers who become robbers a machine gun of facts as if the caller and pellam were resuming a conversation cut short minutes before by an ornery mobile phone pellam believed the name of the man with whom he was having this animated talk had passed his way a moment before but hed missed it in the onslaught of words uh whos this again tony sloan the surprised staccato voice fired back okay they had never met pellam knew sloan of course but then so did everyone who read premiere or people or newsweek a former producer of tv commercials he had directed last years circuit man a computer scifi political thriller a megahit that had snagged oscars for best special effects and best sound and had grossed thirtysix million dollars its first weekend against a total budget of seventyeight million pellam had seen the first two of sloans films and none of the rest he preferred not to work for directors like tony sloanspecialeffects directors he considered them not people directorsbut that day in montana he had listened to the man with some interest for two reasons first after his recent hit sloan could write very large checks to those he hired and never be questioned by his studio second sloan was explaining with a gravity surprising for a child of television that he wanted to make a movie with some meat on it artistically i want to expand a badlands tone you know what i mean minimal essential pellam had liked badlands and his favorite films were minimal and essential he felt he should hear sloan out john ive asked around people say you been all over the country they say youre a walking site catalog perhaps not but pellam did have many scrapbooks filled with polaroid snaps of quirky cinematic locales just right for the sort of feature film that sloan was describing moreover sloan had less location experience than most directors because his flicks were usually soundstage setups and computer graphics transfers to make his movie hed need a solid location manager keep talking pellam said theyre bank robbers sloan was explaining young bank robbers its a vehiclefor like aidan quinn and julia roberts before she was julia roberts i dont want to go with anybody whos been on the cover of people nobody bankable its got me scared but i need to make this change between you and me im suffocating under the system you know what im saying pellam did and he told sloan so theyre not understood this couple theyre angry theyre disaffected listening to sloan back then pellam had seen what he believed were the black hills they werent black at all but were dark blue they were very far away but in the awesome undisturbed sky towering above they looked both regal and unsettling it sounds vaguely familiar tony i know youre thinking bonnie and clyde sloan said ah right that was what pellam had been thinking thiss different the director continued its called missouri river blues you hear about it orion was kicking it around a few years ago before it was bellyup time these characters are real they live and breathe dunaway and beatty were dunaway and beatty what can i say good movie one of my primal influences but im going beyond it okay ross thats the boyfriend hes in prison and going crazy hes going to loll himself he cant take it anymore we open on these incredible shots of a lockdown thats when see in prison when they close up the maximumsecurity cellblock for the night right howd you know that tell me about the film tony ive got the dp working on a special micro lens angles on the insides of the locks and bars clanging shut its beautiful so we get a sense of confinement everything closing around him well ross escapes and he and dehlia dehlia he and dehlia drive around the countryside robbing armored trucks mostly theyre highwaymen modern highwaymen rosss driven by his fear of the lockdown shes driven by the social convention that forces women to be homemakers claustrophobia the script plays off the risk of freedom versus the fear of imprisonment which is worse prison with its security freedom with its dangers it sounds a lot like bonnie and clyde no no the characters are all different also the freedom of love versus its confinement oh and the kidsre concerned about the environment he added significantly thiss the early fifties theyre concerned about abomb testing abombs pellam said thats very socially conscious sloan completely missed the irony and pellam asked set in missouri i presume mediumsized town sloan said the postwar boom has passed it by that sort of town bonnie and clyde was set in missouri pellam pointed out part of it anyway its not like bonnie and clyde the director said icily pellam flipped through his mental rolodex of locations he knew in the midwest i did a job in kansas a few years back small town on a river hows kansas i want missouri the title you know pellam asked could you tell kansas from missouri i grew up in van nuys i cant tell ohio from colorado but thats not the point i want missouri got it sloan now paused the thing is john ive got some timing problems here the tail of the sentence wagged silently timing you know ive had nothing but headaches with the project you know the time article about me last year i missed it pellam said when they called me the hightech visionary pellam said that whatever they had called him hed still missed the article i mean sony or disney would have written a check for the gnp of france if id made the sequel son of circuit man pellam thought then reconsidered he said circuit man rewired ha john very good very funny but missouri river it was a battle to get the green light its an action film but its a period action film and its an intelligent period action film that scared people perhaps competing with kurosawa and altman and john fordand arthur penn the director of bonnie and clyde scared people too so what are you saying tony im saying that im in a bind i got the goahead yesterday and i need locations in two weeks absolute maximum pellam laughed a laugh that terrifies producers and directors it means not only are you asking the impossible but i dont need the job nearly badly enough to put up with the crap i know im going to have to put up with to do what you want six pellam said he was in fact ready to leave that nightjust as soon as the black hills turned truly black and he finished his beer but two weeks was impossible to find sites for the hundreds of setups in a fulllength feature it was the moment when one of them would say four weeks and they would shake hands remotely on the compromise tony sloan said you find me locations in two weeks and ill pay you twentyfive thousand dollars pellam felt heat flow from his black hair down into his throat he believed his skin was flushed well thirtyfive thirtyfive thousand im a desperate man pellam im not going to bullshit you after a pause pellam asked tony tell me does a texas ranger track them down in the end and machinegun them to death it is a goddamn different movie pellam deal express mail the script to me care of kansas city gpo four days later pellam drove over the city limits into maddox missouri braked the winnebago to a stop and knew hed just earned himself some big money missouri river blues scene exterior evening street in front of bank medium angle on ross and dehlia dressed up as if they were out for an innocent stroll they are supposed to be casing the job but ross is introspective he stops angle on real estate office rosss pov cu of listing sheets of onefamily houses angle on rosss face angle on dehlias face looking at him two shot of both of them ross there was a time when i needed to be an outlaw but its different now close on his face since you and meve been on the road together lover its all different now ive got you and i want to be part of the world weve been looking in on looking in on from the outside for a long long time the bankrobbing lovers in the film come upon a small midwestem river town filled with abandoned factories and characters whose lives have been ruined by rampant capitalism they decide to make one last heist then follow the lead of all the returning world war ii veterans buy a house in the burbs and raise babies more than even minimal or essential movies pellam loved good movies he was not convinced that missouri river blues was a good movie the script contained a number of time bombslong speeches shootouts car chases and stylish camera directions but a script is merely a promise what sloan would make of it nobody perhaps not even sloan himself could know at this point it was not pellams job in any case to careercounsel visionaries he did what hed been hired to do he read the script ten times got a sense of what it was about did his outline of the scenes blocked them out consolidating similar ones to minimize travel between locations then he clocked seven hundred miles on the winnebago as he threaded through maddox and environs shot sixty packs of polaroids met with the mayor and the citys insurance company then wrote up his report and shipped it off within a day sloan and the director of photography flew to st louis and drove north where sloan approved most of the locations they jetted back that night to finish casting for the next week pellam helped the key grip with site preparation and deciding what cranes and other equipment would be needed for the shooting sloan and the cast and crew had arrived in a swirl of frenzied excitement grip trucks camera cranes winnebagos location vans this movie was bigger news in maddox than fdr and william jennings bryan combined as on most sets the atmosphere was boisterous in the first few days of shooting pellam had had some fun because scouts are often first on the scene newly arrived personnel ask them for tips on places to eat and things to see a young hotshot actor playing one of rosss gangsters asked pellam bluntly where he could get laid and how much would it cost pellam thought for a bit then remembered an ad he had seen not long after he arrived in maddox itll be cheap but youve got to drive a ways he gave the actor elaborate directions that sent him ten miles into the boonies he returned an hour later fuming and stormed onto the set where pellam and the crew greeted him with highpitched squeals and calls of sooeee pellam had sent him to the st charles county hog and ham museum but that had been a month ago and now the time for jokes was over missouri river blues was badly overschedule and vastly overbudget the producer from the studio financing the film had sent a representative sloan referred to him openly as the stoolieto goose things along the problem in pellams view was that while sloan could entice performances from characters fighting to the death with lasers or changing themselves into charges of electricity he did not know what he wanted in less apocalyptic scenes love betrayal friendship longing so the introspective scenes were gradually replaced by more shootouts and chases and extreme closeups of guns being loaded and dynamite bombs being assembled and armored truck locks being picked or blown apart and all the while sloan shot more and more film he averaged ten thousand feet a dayalmost two hours worth of film from which to distill out about two minutes of real screen time its an asshole picture the lean balding key grip complained to pellam meaning the movie was not being made here as it was filmed but would be cut and pasted together at the back end of the whole process in the editing room desperate tony was shooting as much footage as he possibly could out of which he would hammer together his movie hitchcock didnt work that way the grip whispered after principal photography started pellam thought that he would have plenty of time on his own the bulk of a location managers work would normally be finished at this stage he had merely to oversee paying site rentals on schedule and keep track of permits and insurance binders but more and more frequently he found himself waiting for calls from an increasingly anxious sloansuch as this morning which summons now had him racing at seventy miles an hour through the bleak and abandoned streets of maddox missouri which might have been a businessmans nightmare but was at least a motorcyclists dream four pellam put a twelvefoot skid mark from the curb to the catering table on the set of missouri river blues and hopped off the yamaha only to find the dusty ford taurus braking to a stop six inches from his thigh pellam shrugged and stile emerged from the ford out of sorts he had lost the race because he had stopped for a red light that pellam had ignored didnt know we werent playing by the rules stile grumbled wandering off toward wardrobe ill gitcha next time pellam walked to the scaffolding that rose above that mornings setup tony sloan was a hawkish man muscular very lean in the face which was why he sported a black beard he was wearing blue jeans and a faded green tshirt his black hair dusted with gray was pulled back in a short ponytail occasionally he talked frantically other times not at all his eyes perhaps reflecting his thoughts would either dart about or lift slowly and hover before descending momentarily onto the face of the person he was speaking with these eyes now landed hungrily on pellam john gotta get that phone fixed listen ive been rethinking the ending i want them to get that house you know he fidgeted with his beeper ross and dehlia ive got an image of what they should have i can see it you find me one a fifties sort of house you know a bungalow maybe sloans gaze rose did a few slow circles and returned to pellam who was trying to recall the most recent ending for the film thats instead of what the bus depot sloan answered we dont need the bus depot anymore okay thats easy you want a house you want to do interiors there i dont want to no sloans voice was exasperated why would i want to i didnt mean want to tony i meant are you going to the eyes rose i want to build a set on a soundstage i dont want to have to cram all the damn equipment into a twelvebyfourteenfoot living room but i dont have any choice you want a bungalow with a twelvebyfourteen living room well i want bigger if you can get me bigger ill the voice was very close to pellams ear excuse me he started in surprise they turned one of you john pellam pellam smiled a greeting im detective gianno thiss detective hagedom with the maddox police department pellam saw id cards and gold badges and immediately forgot their names an italian detective darkcomplected and short and a wasp detective blond athletic tall he had a very square jaw pellam smelled aftershave something dry he had been close to cops a few times in his life and could not recall smelling aftershave on a law enforcer sloan said whats this all about his eyes now alighted on the italian detectives and remained fixed the cop asked in response whore you tony sloan when they registered no response he added im the director the wasp turned away from him if youll excuse us wed like to talk to mr pellam here if theres some problem im in charge of there wont be a problem sir he glanced at sloan as if he were a nagging panhandler if youd just give us a few minutes alone with mr pellam here sloan gave him an astonished glance then turned to pellam who shrugged ill get you that house tony the director wandered off to a motorized camera crane a chapman apollo the boom extended and the camera platform nearly ten feet above the ground sloan paused in the shadow of the boom and glanced back at the two men now standing on either side of pellam several grips and gaffers noticed sloans frown and stopped what they were doing to watch the three men the wasp stepped closer the scent of lime was very strong the postdispatch did a story about this film he spoke with the same stilted formality that marks conversations between cops and civilians all around the world its a crime movie about bank robbers the italian detective said this as if people would not think of breaking the law if movies didnt put the idea into their heads armored car robbers pellam corrected weve never had a movie made in maddox he added solemnly i hope you portray the town in a good light weve had our share of trouble but thats not our fault no it isnt said the wasp what exactly pellam asked do you want last night there was a shooting were wondering if you could give us some information about it around here it happened on third near the river he tried to remember if he had heard anything he couldnt recall but with the tape deck playing and the cardinals on tv and the noise of five men playing poker a lot of sound outside would get missed pellam shook his head im sorry i dont think i can help you he started to walk away the wasp detective put a firm grip on pellams shoulder and laughed in surprise like a schoolteacher insulted by a student hey hey hold up there a minute were not through yet pellam shrugged the hand off and turned around i cant help you well we think you can sir a policeman was shot and critically injured and two people were killed vincent gaudia and a miss sally ann moore im sorry that doesnt mean anything to me people are killed and you dont care the wasp asked his hands palms up rose at his sides i dont mean that i just mean i dont know who they are the italian was saying the car the lincoln does that ring a bell no i oh wait there was this guy got out of a big car maybe it was a lincoln i didnt really notice id bought some beer he bumped into me could you describe him was he the guy who was killed description not too tall stocky balding a beard or mustache i think mid or late thirties race white any scars or markings i dont remember any what was he wearing a jacket i think jeans dark mostly he was alone in the lincoln no there was somebody else they drove off after a while they well he could you describe him i didnt see him the detectives didnt exactly exchange glances but their eyes swung like slow pendulums toward each other sloan called pellam you gonna get me that house or what the italian detective called back this is official police business mister oh brother pellam cocked his head helplessly at sloan and said theyre just asking me a few questions sloan continued to stare for a moment eyes no longer flitting with artistic distraction but now boring angrily into the cluster of men from the shadow of the crane the thing is mr pellam the italian cop continued the officer who was shot he was shot a number of times in the back his partner said god thats awful said he saw you talking to someone in the car he he was the one got shot that policeman danny what was the name donnie buffett thats terrible yeah i was talking to him is he going to be okay they dont know the italian cop said in the thick silence that followed they stared at him pellam felt guilty under these gazes i didnt see him the driver i mean i looked i looked into the car but i wasnt really talking to him i was just saying things it wasnt like a conversation how did you know it was a man pellam didnt speak for a moment thats a good question i dont really i just assumed it was you seem pretty sure it was a man the wasp said you said him i was assuming it was a man the italian cop said itd just be kind of strange wouldnt it youre standing a few feet from someone not to at least see what they were wearing what their sex was whether they were black or white i dont know whats strange or not but thats what happened it was night adams is lit up like gateway park the italian cop said the wasp detective looked at his partner all those car accidents thats why they put in sodium vapors there was glare pellam said that was one of the problems on the windows i was blinded so the fact it was night wasnt the problem said the wasp i mean you said it was night as if you meant it was too dark to see anything but now what youre saying is it wasnt dark at all it was too bright i guess pellam said what kind of lincoln was it black what kind how do you mean town car continental i didnt notice i wish i had but i only remember it being big and black youre sure it was black well it was dark navy blue maybe they asked about license plates dents scratches damage bumper stickers pellam couldnt help them the cops fell silent do you think im lying its just kind of strange is all were saying whats strange pellam rocked on his boot heels being so close and all and not seeing anything the wasp said thats strange it was dark pellam tried to sound as frustrated as they were and there was a lot of glare the italian added sarcastic pellman couldnt tell officer buffett said he saw you talking to whoever was in the car i told you i wasnt having a conversation with him or her pellam saw in the distance the curtain in a window of sloans van pull aside for a moment a black gap was visible and in that gap pellam imagined he could see the two tiny paranoid eyes of an impatient visionary director he said to the wasp who though bigger seemed more reasonable look im very busy just now this is a bad time for this the blond cop just repeated officer buffett said you were talking to the driver what are we supposed to think about that pellam sighed i was mad i was just talking to let off steam i dont remember what i said i was muttering why were you mad the guy i told you about the one who got out of the car bumped into me and i dropped a case of beer why did he do that it was an accident he didnt do it on purpose if it was an accident the wasp asked slowly why were you so mad you were talking to yourself the italian cop offered muttering you said okay thats it ive got nothing more to say pellam started away tensing his muscles ready for another vise grip neither cop followed but the blond said theres two dead people and a cop shot in the back his partner offered people sometimes get scared they dont want to volunteer to be witnesses you dont have to be worried we can protect you i didnt see anybody get shot all i saw was some guy who nearly knocked me on my ass were more concerned with the person in the car we think hes the one who ordered the hit sorry now if theres nothing else pellam lifted his hands like a tv preacher confronted with more sin than he can absolve will you at least help us do a sketch of the man you saw yes sure but not now the wasp cop shifted his weight like an impatient college boy he was no longer reasonable hes not going to cooperate cooperate the wasp said to his grimacing partner lets go hes a gfy the cops put their notebooks away whats a gfy pellam demanded an official term we use about reluctant witnesses im not reluctant i didnt see anything when they got to the perimeter of the set the italian cop turned suddenly and said look mister a lot of local people cooperated with you so you could shoot this damn movie here they arent going to be too happy to hear youre not so cooperative in return the wasp cop waved his arm aw hes a gfy why bother they walked off the set in sloans trailer the curtain fell closed the indictments against him read counts conspiracy to sell controlled substances counts criminal federal income tax fraud count conspiracy to interfere with civil rights count perjury count extortion counts criminal violations of the racketeeringinfluenced corrupt organizations act peter crimmins did not exactly have the words memorized but thisthe paraphrasehe knew the essence of the governments case against him crimmins the name was his fathers impulsive recasting of crzniolak was fiftyfour he had a body like a pear a face like a potato his hair was combed forward in bangs frank sinatra style over his high forehead on which a single dark mole rested above his left eyebrow like a misplaced third eye he was presently sitting in his office which overlooked the parking lot of his trucking company and through windows in the opposite wall a large room filled with gray desks filing cabinets overhead fluorescent fixtures and a dozen office workers who appeared simultaneously bored and anxious peter crimmins had a thousand business decisions he should be making but it was the words of the indictment that kept running through his mind and they made him furious oh several counts were nonsense and had been thrown in by an eager runt of an assistant us attorney the civil rights thing ridiculous conspiracy ridiculous the drug counts were absurd he had never sold an atom of any controlled substance the extortion well that was somewhat true but only a little but what infuriated him were the counts that were accuratethe rico charges peter crimmins thought of himself as a bluecollar philosopher and had decided that there were simple rules in life you could figure out without anyones help not the ten commandments which were a little too simpleminded even for a good russian orthodox like him to buy but rules like a mans dignity should be respected take care of those who cannot take care of themselves do your duty support your family dont hurt anyone innocent you live your life by those rules and you will do just fine so here he was doing his duty supporting his family not hurting anyone anybody innocent at any rate making a living going to church occasionallyand what happens he runs smack into another set of rules and these rules made no sense to him at all they were pure idiocy the problem was that they were collected in title of the united states code and if you happened to break these rules people would come after you and try to put you in jail but what was the most frustrating of all was that he was wrestling with these fortyfour indictments solely because of a single mistake which was that he had hired a maniac vincent gaudia now deceased gunned down the day before the two men were contrasts crimmins had noticed this immediately at their first meeting in a german restaurant in webster groves missouri crimmins was unflashy he had years of experience as a labor negotiator before he left the union and opened his own business he drank vodka in moderation and smoked camels and wore boxer shorts and white shirts and combed his hair with vitalis every day and he loved playing pool and boccie with friends he had known for years he was faithful to his wife of thirtythree years and he served on the planning and zoning commission of his suburban hometown crimmins was a controlled man a disciplined man a solid man gaudia on the other hand was a man controlled by his appetites he wanted womens bodies and wet food and sweet drinks with straws gaudias primary organs were his tongue and his penis still crimmins had been in business long enough to know that other peoples weaknesses can be your strengths he had noted gaudias lusts and hired the man immediately because gaudia was more than a minor hood with a busy tongue he was one of the bestconnected people in eastern missouri and southern illinois crimmins checked around and got a feel for the labyrinthine network vince gaudia was hooked into it was inspiring the pipeline did not reach to washington and curiously gaudia could not fix a parking ticket in st louis but hundreds of those in betweencourt clerks judges councilmen county executives banking commissioners administrative agency workers in st louis jeff city and springfieldwere all snug in his pocket and his skills went beyond knowing who they extended to how he had a feel for the ethics who would take a case of j b but resent a gift of money who would take a junket who a job for their kid a p z decision reversal a coop in vail gaudia was an expert at bartering and the product he dealt in was influence crimmins who had established the most complicated and highvolume moneylaundering operation in the midwest decided vince gaudia could make a major contribution to his company the match looked heavensent and although they were temperamental opposites gaudia and crimmins hit it off extremely well crimminss laundering was making bold inroads into kansas city and he had an eye on chicago he pioneered the use of notforprofit organizations as moneylaundering vehicles and was probably the only person in the world certainly the only christian who cleaned money through both an orthodox synagogue in university city and a nation of islam mosque in east st louis both unwitting coconspirators crimminss business with gaudia as his lieutenant would have become one of the major profitable enterprises in the metropolitan area if it were not for the coincidental occurrence of two things the first was a network tv news expose minutes no lessabout a problem in the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of missouri there had been a string of bungled drug cases well putting bad guys away is not easy and the good guys get cut a lot of slack from judges but these slipups were so egregious and so lipsmackingly exposed on nationwide tvthat the attorney general himself took action he called the us attorney for the eastern district ronald peterson and brought him to washington for a talk about the botched prosecutions peterson kept his job by a thread and returned from dc with a renewed sense of devotion to put away people like peter crimmins the second coincidence was that vince gaudia slept with the wrong woman he would not have described her that way probably she was a sullen brunette with long icy red nails and disks of green eyes she talked in a littlegirl singsong voice that made his mind glaze over instantly but forced his cock to attention just about as fast they had only one date during which they became wildly drunk and made love for four hours she claimed later that he proposed she come live with him in his riverfront coop gaudia did not remember saying that nor when she finally tracked him down after a week of not returning her phone calls did he remember her name she apparently had a much better memory than he did however and in a letter to us attorney peterson described almost verbatim many of the secrets a drunken vince gaudia had shared with her us attorney peterson saw a chance to redeem his career and wired an fbi agent who posed as an administrative hearing judge he met with gaudia in a bad italian restaurant near the gateway arch after a little softshoe the agent accepted five thousand dollars in exchange for agreeing to overlook an epa violation by one of gaudias clients one minute later gaudia was arrested and about an hour after that a deal was struck in exchange for a probation plea recommendation gaudia would hand over peter crimminss balls on a fourteenkarat gold plate but now gaudia was dead as a rock and peter crimmins knew that us attorney peterson had yet another count he wished to add to those fortyfour indictments crimminss murder of a government witness crimmins was lost in thought about this situation when the outer door to his office opened and his lawyer entered they shook hands and the man sat the lawyer was beefy with an automatic pilot of a smile that would lack in at any time for no seeming reason he played tennis on powerful legs and drove a porsche he said things like pete my man id look at that deal with a proctoscope and as your counselor and as your friend id advise you crimmins had never told the man he was his friend the lawyer now asked bluntly where were you friday night what are you asking i gotta know pete were you with anybody you think i killed gaudia crimmins asked i dont ask my clients if theyre guilty or not i want to establish your alibi not your innocence well im telling you crimmins said i didnt loll anybody the lawyer tightened the titanium knot of his silk tie did you hint to anybody crimmins raised his voice i didnt do it the lawyer looked sideways and clearly did not believe this denial its not what i think its what the us attorney is going to think and ill tell you with gaudia gone petersons got you by a lot less short hairs than he did two days ago crimmins knew this of course you think the indictment wont stick petersons a whore pup your conviction is his ticket to dc he believes in his soul you killed gaudia and hes going to turn you fucking i dont like those words you use crimmins muttered inside out your case gets thrown out hes going to lose his media defendant there are plenty of defendants to go around the lawyer was losing patience but he wants you youre the one he told the world he was going to get youre the one he had hell be a bitch in heat mark my words this is selective prosecution crimmins believed he knew enough law to be a lawyer himself ive got your closing statement all prepared pete i dont need to hear your version of it why was crimmins putting his lifewell his liberty and pursuit of happiness at leastinto the hands of this slick man with a resonant belly and a vicious backhand iffor the sake of argumentyou had to have an alibi humor me pete if if if you had to have an alibi for the time that gaudia was shot would you have one crimmins did not answer the lawyer sighed all right what im going to do is ask around some see who knows what see what petersons going to do about this ive got some friendsre cops they owe me supposedly theres a witness nobodys found yet a witness its just a rumor some guy who saw the shooter the lawyer stood up another thing they think the getaway car was a lincoln crimmins was silent for a moment he said softly i drive a lincoln a darkcolored lincoln is what they said peter crimmins had selected midnight blue he found it a comforting color the lawyer walked to the door pulling his shortbrimmed hat on his bulletshaped head wait peter crimmins said the lawyer stopped and turned this witness i dont care what you have to do what it costs the lawyer was suddenly very uncomfortable his hand went to his belly and he rubbed the spot where presumably his sumptuous breakfast was being digested you want me to find out who he is and just find out peter crimmins whispered very softly as if every lampshade and picture frame in the room contained a microphone five hes lying donnie buffett said into the telephone detective bob gianno said no doubt about it what he did buffett continued he bent down and looked into the car from just three feet away no not even one foot away if he says he didnt see anything hes lying gianno said all hes gotta do is talk and the cases a grounder nothing to it a hose job buffet said youll keep on him oh you bet donnie boy you bet they hung up buffetts stemach was growling regularly but he didnt feel hungry they were giving him something from a thick plastic bag a clear liquid that dripped into his arm maybe glucose he wondered if that was a good idea because glucose was sugar and before the shooting he had been meaning to lose a few pounds he thought about the doughnut and coffee pellam had brought him was it just last night two nights ago it could have been a week why was pellam lying about seeing the killers partner afraid probably the door pushed wider open and a doctor came into the room he was a compact man about forty with thick black hair trim with muscular forearms which made buffett think that he was an orthopedics man buffett loved sports all kinds of sports every sport and he knew jock docs they were always in good shape he pulled a chair close to die bed sat down and introduced himself his name was gould he had a low pleasing voice i guess i met you before buffett said you operated on me i was one of the neurosurgeons yes gould lifted the chart from the rack and flipped it open he skimmed it set it down he leaned forward and with a penlight looked into buffetts eyes he asked the policeman to watch the doctors finger as it did figure eights then to extend his arms and touch his nose donnie buffett did as he was told the doctor said good which did not mean good or anything else then he asked how you feeling officer okay i guess my shoulder stings ah he examined buffetts chart again and he examined it for a very long moment it seemed to buffett doctor buffetts voice faded the doctor did not encourage him to continue he closed the metal cover of the chart and said officer id like to talk to you about your injury tell you exactly what happened what we did what were going to do sure you were shot in the back several slugs hit your bulletproof vest they were smallcaliberand shattered right away a third bullet hit the top side of the vest it was deflected but it grazed your scapula your shoulder blade thats the pain you feel there its a minor wound we removed the bullet easily theres some risk of sepsisthats infectionbut the odds are that wont happen gould was taking out a pen a fancy gold and lacquer pen and was drawing what looked like the lower half of a skeleton on the back of a receipt donnie three of the bullets hit you below the vest they entered here thats where the lumbar region of the spinal cord joins the sacral region one shattered and stopped here the pen top replaced was now a pointer the other two lodged in your intestine but missed the kidneys and bladder we removed all the pieces of lead weve repaired the damage with sutures that will absorb into the tissue you wont need any further surgery unless we have a sepsis situation okay buffett said agreeably he squinted and studied the diagram as if hed be tested on it later donnie the bullet that shatteredit entered your spinal cord here buffett was nodding he was a cop he had seen death he had seen pain he had felt pain he was totally calm his injury couldnt be serious if it were hed be hooked up to huge machines respirators and jet cockpit controls all he had was a tube in his dick and an iv that was feeding him fattening sugar that was nothing no problem he felt pain now a wonderful pain that ran through his legs playing hideand seek if he were paralyzed he wouldnt be feeling pain donnie were going to refer you to a dr weiser one of st louiss top sci neurologists and therapists sci thats spinal cord injury but im okay arent i youre not in a lifethreatening condition with upper scis theres a risk of respiratory or cardiac failure those can be very troublesome troublesome but your accident was lower sci that was fortunate in terms of your survival doctor ill be able to walk wont i the thing is my job im a cop i have to walk he lifted his palms as if he were embarrassed to be explaining somediing so simple uhn donnie the doctor said slowly your prognosis is essentially nonambulatory nonambulatory what does buffetts throat closed down and he was unable to complete his question because he knew exacdy what it meant your spinal cord was almost completely severed gould said buffett was looking directly into his eyes but did not see any of the intense sympathy that was pouring from them with the state of the art at the present time im afraid theres nothing we can do about it you wont walk no oh well i see officer youre very lucky you could easily have been killed or it might have been a quadriplegic situation sure thats true gould stood up the chart got replaced on the bed the doctors nifty pen went back into his shirt dr weiser is much more competent to talk about your injury than i am you couldnt ask for a better expert a nurse will be coming by to schedule an appointment later he smiled shook buffetts hand well do everything we can for you officer dont worry about a thing it was several minutes later that donnie buffett said no i wont and only then realized that the doctor was no longer in the room philip lombro had this habit he would polish his shoes at least twice a day he kept a big horsehair brush in his desk at work and a smaller pigbristle brush in his attache case along with chamois squares sometimes he would polish the shoes three four five times in a single day he used kiwi a lot his favorite though was meltonian creme a chaussures he had no obsession over the shoes themselveshe owned only seven pairsand he did not have a foot fetish he was not even sure what a foot fetish was or what somebody with a foot fetish did what he liked was shiny shoes and the process of getting them that way putting your feet into newly polished shoes was a regal feeling this morning he sat in the office of lombro associates in downtown maddox and absently ran the brush over his oxblood wing tips the office was in the shadow of a huge redbrick building that had started life as maddox omnibus and carriage company and had become through the generations maddox electric automobile company then the maddox clutch company and recently the maddox machinery division of fujitomo limited several stiff brush bristles became dislodged from the brush and fell to the floor lombro bent down and picked them up then flicked them into the wastebasket he wiped his fingers with a spitmoistened kleenex outside the window a piece of newspaper floated past and vanished lombro stared at the sides of the maddox omnibus building lombro remembered from ten years ago the reporter photo of a young man who killed himself by jumping off one of the factorys huge smokestacks wearing a suit he had died crumpled in the roof of a delivery truck it enfolded him like a blanket this was what the maddox omnibus and carriage company building signified for him death and this thought in turn led to ralph bales lombro had met ralph bales at the wedding of his sisters daughter lombro never married regretted that hed never been a father nieces and nephews in st louis area became surrogate children he doted he spoiled them he took them on outings he was more astonished than their parents to see them become adults when his brotherinlaw could not pick up the tab for the girls wedding lombro himself paid for the function one of the guests had been ralph bales and what caught lombros attention was that ralph bales had brought a gun to the wedding late in the evening lombro standing at the urinal in the mens john of orsinis restaurant was aware of someone entering behind him and going into a stall he then heard a clunk of something falling and glanced under the door a hand was quickly retrieving a pistol lombro washed his hands quickly and left the mens room he waited outside hiding behind a plant to catch a look at the intruder a few minutes later ralph bales emerged slicking back his thinning hair with damp hands lombro didnt know what to do a friend of a friend on the grooms side ralph bales had been invited true so he probably was not a robber on the other hand lombro felt responsible for the safety of his four hundred guests finally after an agonizing half hour of indecision lombro had walked up to ralph bales and as the children were cutting the cake struck up a conversation he learned that ralph bales had grown up in st louis he was orphaned young as lombro had been and had made a career of various riverfront jobs they talked careers real estate making money losing money ralph bales mentioned vaguely unions and shipping companies and waterfront services and teamsters he lived in a house not far from lambert field he enjoyed working in his garden lombro did too he said though he hated the sun ralph bales said he loved the sun lombro was satisfied that the man represented no danger and said goodbye ralph bales touched him on the arm in a special way and offered his card you say youre in real estate he said with ambiguous significance if you ever need any security consulting let me know so the card ralph bales consultant was filed away in lombros rolodex he thought he might have a need for a consultant at some point a month ago he had and now as he put the shoe brush away in his bottom drawer and vacantly watched the papers blowing outside the windows of his office he foresaw that the transaction that arose out of that wedding might have been the only serious mistake he had ever made in his life okay kind of a problem ralph bales now said philip lombro listened his head immobile eyes moving slowly around the face of his visitor he snuck up on us the cop lombro said there was nothing you couldve done ralph bales was deferential to clients he didnt roll his eyes or sigh he said no he came up out of the blue lombro opened his desk he pulled out a thin envelope containing he handed it to ralph bales ralph bales said thank you lombro nodded neither man seemed grateful or pleased by the exchange how much of a problem is it lombro sounded reasonable men like him tend to stay calm when they have problems ralph bales chewed on the thin lip that was cut into his round padded face well you dont want to shoot a cop whatever happens you dont want to do that lombros eyes settled on ralph baless naked upper lip he realized the moustach was gone im not being you know cute ralph bales continued the cops dont get mad when you kill a da witness because witnesses are scum when the cops get mad is when you shoot a cop and and theres some things we have to do such as okay weve got to find the guy that saw us who the guy walked into me when i got out of the car the one with the beer lombro lifted one ankle to his other knee and touched his heel absently then rubbed it he saw me ralph bales said and he saw you they might not find him the police no thats lombro continued an argument that seemed to reassure him why would he volunteer why would anyone do that he might not ralph bales agreed but some people are funny they do weird things lombro said the way youre talking it sounds like youve decided something excuse me it isnt really a decision i mean we dont have a choice okay hit man shoots cop in back the newspaper sat prominently on lombros desk ralph bales had been wrong there was no photo of vince gaudias body just the shot policemans wedding picture i dont like this at all with all respect mr lombro when you he looked for words that werent too incriminating take on a project like this there are potential downsides okay like you buy a building and find out its got termites or something it just happens you cant run away from it the woman too you killed the woman stevie tells me that was an accident gaudia pushed her in front of him lombro was nodding i dont care much about her she knew the kind of bastard she was getting involved with outside the window a blackbird settled on the top of a brick facade the birds nervous glossy head flicked about it shot into the sky in a gray streak ralph bales said we did the job for you and there was a glitch but the fact of the matter is i dont live here and stevie flom dont live here but you do and so this glitch its sort of your problem lombro considered this speech unemotionally what are you proposing i can drive out of here now and you can take your chances or you can pay me to take care of this guy too no absolutely not then ralph bales let the word float through the room like a puff of cigarette smoke theres another option what go on maybe i could find him threaten him scare him a little would that work it usually does but i dont want to do it its a lot riskier than just you know taking care of him you want more money is that what youre saying yeah thats what im saying its just a question of risk ten thousand and hes gone twenty thousand and i find him put pressure on him twenty what do you want me to say nineteen ninetyfive lombro did not speak for a moment he gazed at the newspaper then closed his eyes and flipped his hand forward in a gesture of frustration all right he looked at ralph bales but i want your word that you wont hurt him ralph bales frowned you didnt say you didnt want him hurt i mean lombro said you wont kill him will you ralph bales nodded and looking straight at lombro said of course not i told you i wouldnt he had found that when you look somebody in the eye they will believe anything you tell them the car cruised past the camper slowly by the time pellam was out of the kitchenette and at the window it had turned off of river road and was gone he remained at the window looking out through the blinds which he now noticed could use a good cleaning maddox offered no night parking and pellam was forced to keep the camper in this pathetic trailer park the owners annie and fred bell advertised fifty hookups and during some prior vacation seasons they might all have been used but that would have been before the cement plant went in next door and gouged out five hundred yards of idyllic riverfront grassland replacing it with bunkers and steel docks the bideawee trailer park was currently occupied by john pellams winnebago and two clusters of tenters who were obviouslyand understandablytired of the picturesque view of ochner cement stone and were packing to leave at first pellam had not much cared about the emptiness but that was before he was a witness in a murder case well a sortof witness now he wished for a little more anonymity he looked at his watch it was only am but he had already seen or heard fourno make that fivecars slow as they cruised past the trailer court he suspected the occupants were not checking out the bideawee for upcoming vacation sojourns in maddox but were more interested in him another car now stopped directly in front of the trailer it was a beatup old sedan its fenders attached with gaffer tape the driver was a shadowy form behind a greasestained window the condition of the car told him that this was not the cops come acalling again pellam who had been hacking away at the impossible crust of burnt chili dried his hands and walked to the front of the winnebago he opened a map compartment beside the front door this tiny space did contain maps probably thirty of them all limp and seamtorn it also contained a colt peacemakercaliber pistol it had a steel barrel and rosewood grips he lifted the gun out and thumbed open the cylinder cover pellam put the pistol on halfcock loaded five of the six chambers then eased the hammer down on the empty slot he slipped the gun into his waistband pulled on his bomber jacket and left the camper striding toward the car why did everybody in maddox have somber cars the driverpellam did not recognize himwas a man of about forty with a square face eyes staring evenly at him pellam had hoped that he would see pellam coming to confront him and burn rubber to escape the man shut off the engine and got out pellams hand casually went to the zipper of his jacket the intruder was huge he slammed the door with a loud bang he kept staring at pellam then he started across the street he had a crew cut and folds of skin hung over his eyes pellam unzipped his jacket and stood by the roadside his hand rested on his belt and he rubbed the buckle with an index finger he touched the wood grip of the gun when the man reached the shoulder of the road twenty feet away he stopped looking straight into pellams eyes he said you need any young men pellam squinted and cocked his head the man repeated young men im sorry look the man said stiffly i know you hear that a lot of folk arent happy to have you all in town because youre saying things about maddox in your movie that arent so nice well you wont hear that from me i dont feel that way at all uhhuh good now the man continued his recitation my boy larrys seventeen and was most recent in a play i mean a serious play without music i remember mama he was goodid say that even he wasnt my sonbut hed be topnotch in a movie where you get to say your lines over and over again and they take the best one i mean topnotch well sir i dont do any casting hell do it real reasonable you know just to get his foot in the door so to speak could do manual labor too till an acting part comes round hes strapping pellam shook his head hes taking classes sorry pellam zipped up his jacket i wish i could help out but i cant the man stood shoulders drooping and face bright red behind him was a decrepit house that at one time was a marvel of victorian excess it had been abandoned halfway through a futile makeover he said in a stiff voice ive been out of work three years now was a deckhand for a inland tow company im about at the end of my rope im sorry i dont want sympathy id work if there was any work but there aint larrys bout the only chance weve got for some income pellam shook his head wish it were different sure the man stood for a moment longer thanks for your time he turned silently and walked back to his car he looked at the camper then started the engine pellam watched the car roll away followed by the bubbling sound of a rustshot muffler he trudged back to the camper disarmed himself and hung up his jacket he returned to the kitchenette a half hour later he was sitting at the tiny table flipping through his maddox location file which was filled with polaroid snapshots as tony sloan had requested hed taken a number of shots of empty housesnearly every other house in certain parts of townand he had narrowed the bungalow search down to four two of them cute and two rundown he was checking the addresses against a tattered map of maddox that was when he heard the hesitant footsteps on the gravel walk pellams hands froze on the report had larrys dad returned for another audition pellam stood and walked to the rear of the camper peering out no it was a different car a dark red sedan the sort the italian and the wasp detectives would drive it turned out not to be the two cops however without knocking a darkcomplected man in his midthirties stepped inside and looked around orienting himself he wore a trim doublebreasted charcoal gray suit and reflective blue sunglasses he said i know what youre hoping for but give it up youre not getting out of here the door swung shut and he slowly pulled his sunglasses off and slipped them into his breast pocket six pellam pursed his lips together he shook his head what the intruder asked its i know what youre thinking but its too late youre not getting out of here no the man frowned im sure he propped a briefcase on the drivers seat and opened it anyway ive decided to cut the dialogue do it in visuals want coffee its instant a script appeared from the briefcase and the man began thumbing through it aw no pellam dont cut it its a great line but give it up its verywhats the wordanachronistic oh youre right he read the script carefully the lines gone take a pew pellam said and put the kettle on the flame marty weller easily settled his lanky frame into the dining banquette a yoga practitioner he possessed the sort of physique that could comfortably handle a camper environment he had an airbrushed tan and muscles in places where only a nautilus machine could put them where his trimmed eyebrows ended above his nose there appeared california creasestwo short vertical furrows the result of a lifetime of squinting tea herbal he tapped the script i must have been thinking of the first draft or the second or one of them you rewrite a hell of a lot john lipton weller looked about as if he might spot a box of celestial seasonings chamomile hidden nearby okay he said with reservation then honey domino well this is middle america weller smiled slyly and asked so yes you know what im asking whats the scoop on sloan independent producer marty weller was as much a gossip sponge as anyone in hollywoodthough he was not sufficiently powerful to use much of the gossip he absorbed he had done a string of offbeat films that were lukewarm hits this opened doors for him but did not automatically get his pictures made still gossip about tony sloan while not particularly useful to weller was platinum gossip one wanted it the same way one wanted taittinger or beluga yet wellers presence here in smalltown missouri now reminded pellam of la protocol and cognizant of his obscenely large fee he recalled the rule assume anything you say even in strictest confidence will immediately be transmitted to the hollywood reporter and attributed to you pellam gave weller a diluted version of the films production woes word is hes cindering in the upper atmosphereweller said with a frown that did nothing to mask his delight pellam shrugged okay marty dont keep me in suspense go or no go weller picked up the battered blackcovered script he had just misquoted the title was central standard time were close john damn close ive got maybe eighty percent of the financing in place he fell silent for a minute and riffled the pages in his former me which in hollywood meant only a few years ago pellam had both written and directed independent films central standard time had been the film hed been working on when his career had been derailed in a big way no one had been interested in the property until immaculately tanned marty weller had appeared on pellam s doorstep and told him with as much sincerity as a hollywood producer could muster that he was going to get pellams vision turned into a dark arthouse classic finally he said delicately there were some questions about what happened before he looked up uncomfortably you were actually in production we were two weeks into principal photography weller did not look up but intently read what happened to be the blank back cover of the script when he got sick you mean got sick pellam said thats right tommy bernsteinthe leading man in central standard and pellams best friendhad not gotten sick at all but had died of a cocaineinduced heart attack during principal photography which had brought the production to a halt and pellams life as hed lived it to a shattering conclusion weller was flipping through the script and sending a stale breeze up into the air somebody im just explaining why its taking so long this is bullshit i know but somebody talked about a jinx pellam laughed like the exorcist stories that old crap people are more superstitious about money than about their lives more producers fly on friday the thirteenth than write checks you better believe it well nothing i can do about that and you directing thats still carved in stone pellam noted that the cautious tone in the mans voice was not going away he said firmly yep the thing is john well youve been out of the loop for a long time i direct or they dont get property its a dealbreaker and theyre saying if they dont get to pick the director leads and dp we dont get the money theyll mexican standoff theyll let you coproduce i think theyll even go gross points since you wrote it producing means nothing to me it means a shitload of money is what it means look john the budget is seven million he tapped the script its got film noir cult classic written all over it were going to shoot in black and white for gods sake this is going to make money it cannot not make money marty pellam said patiently wellers momentarily wide eyes shrank to a more sober size forgive me i know not who i bullshit okay think about this alternative can you get up two hundred two twenty what if i can we cut back to four million finance it ourselves shoot with unknowns and pucker up at the sight of every distributors backside you can direct pellam realized the teakettle was filling the small kitchen with steam he made himself coffee and weller a cup of tea while he was mentally adding a second mortgage on his house selling his old porsche and adding in the fee for missouri river blues one twenty one fifty maybe i can do weller performed his own calculations id have to make some phone calls but i think if you come in with that we can get it done for that you can direct but you dont get points youd work for scale and maybe have to kick some back i want this film made ive never wanted to get rich you always were a crazy sonofabitch pellam weller sipped the hot tea holding it inches above the table and lowering his mouth to the rim i should tell you one thing though never rains but it pours paramounts interested in a property i optioned last year terrorist hijacking thing cliche cliche cliche i know mea culpa budgeted at fortyfive its not going to happen but ive still got to go to london to meet with some people about it what if it does happen i want to do your film john for a moment the passion beneath the silken tan seemed real in his obscure way weller was explaining that he would rather be a producer who was a cult artist and rich than one who was commercial and excessively rich hollywood pellam knew is a crucible of tradeoffs next step he asked he took a sip of coffee then poured it out his gut was wound up not often is one offered the opportunity to direct his own picture and to go hopelessly into debt at the same time i leave tomorrow night for london let me get on the horn now and see what i can do but i give you my word if we can work it im doing central standard itll be a bitch but id tell paramount so long byebye i dont care how many effing zeros they wave in my face does that shock you john does it it did but pellam said no marty it impresses me the bungalows wouldnt work the interiors were too small for a panaflex and lightsand actors all at the same time sloan had wanted a complicated tracking shot where the camera on a doorway dolly starts in the yard and follows a characters point of view into the living room but he finally agreed with pellam and the key grip that the scene would have to be edited together they would shoot the exteriors of the bungalows the most decrepit of the four and the interiors in the parlor and living room of a twostory colonial next door pellam left tony sloan barking instructions to the gaunt key grip whose resilient humor from the first several weeks of shooting had vanished completely under the weight of tasks like this one completing in six hours a setup that would normally take two days pellam hopped back on his cycle and drove to the bank that held the deeds on both houses the banker wearing a pastel green suit had carefully read the standard location release and signed it accepting the sixhundreddollar check with an air of embarrassment most money them housesve made in two years timesre rough round here looks like yessir that they have been i just wish this recession would hurry up and get done well get through it though pellam returned to the bike and fired it up as he drove through town he noticed a car following keeping the same distance behind two people in the front seat he believed pellam made two unnecessary turns the car took the same route he braked the cycle to a stop and pretended to look into a storefront window of dusty antiques while the driver of the car stopped and pretended to look at a map eyes still scanning the window of the store pellam suddenly popped the bike into first and squealed away from the stop turning down a narrow walkway between two deserted buildings a space just wide enough to leave about an inch on either side of the handlebar grips he could touch neither the front brake nor clutch without leaving knuckle skin on brick when he emerged from the alley he braked to a fast stop and saw the car was skidding to a halt at the far end of the alley pellam made a sharp turn down a oneway street and aimed toward a strip of brown river after he had driven for a block he felt a strong sense of deja vu and slowed dropping down into first gear the car was nowhere around him and guided by instinct he turned right and parked he was on third street next to a series of low factories and warehouses from here he could see what had at one time probably been maddoxs budding riverfront scene now it contained only empty storefronts uninspired antique stores bars and callaghans steak house this was also the place where donnie buffett had been shot pellam noticed something beside his booted foot bloodstains he believed though they may have been nothing more than antifreeze or chocolate milk ill keep an eye on them you want to get a bag or something yeah sure thanks pellam parked the bike and found a phone booth the phone worked which surprised him upon calling directory assistance he also was surprised to learn that the address he sought was only a block away pellam did not care for the smell of the place something about antiseptics that sweet cheapperfume smell of chilly stuff that gets dabbed on your skin before they cut or stick also the design was depressing aluminum bright vinyl linoleum for some reason orange was very popular orange and purple pellam had been in old hospitals where you really got a sense of medicinedark woodwork and brass and pale green as if somebody were discovering anesthetic or penicillin behind one of the goldstenciled doors maddox general was like life and death in kmart pellam signed in the nurse pointed him down the hallway pellam walked past a cop stationed at the head of the corridor he eyed pellam carefully hold up there sir id like to see officer buffett youre the witness the cops stony face remained immobile his eyes painted pellam up and down i just want to see how hes doing open your jacket i you want to see him open your jacket pellam opened his jacket the cop frisked him roughly and motioned toward buffetts room on the tv was a game show the sound was low everything but the loudest applause was inaudible the reception wasnt very good and there was a thick band of distortion through the center of the screen the host and the contestants were smiling a lot buffett wasnt how you doing pellam asked and identified himself i remember you pellam walked to a gray chair he stood as if deciding whether or not to sit i brought you this he put a book a recent bestseller on the table its a mystery i dont know if you like them buffett kept staring at him pellam cleared his throat the silence filled in again he said i didnt know if youd like a bottle what dyou drink anyway beer i got shot in the back i heard how you feeling how do you think i feel silence again pellam decided there wasnt going to be any lighthearted banter and joshing he stood back from the chair and crossed his arms look im sorry about what happened but id like to ask a favor your buddies in the police department a couple detectives particularly are giving me a pretty hard time you know following me they think i saw this guy who was in the car buffett eyes on the tv screen blurted well you did i didnt see him pellam said evenly i know you think i did but i didnt buffett kept staring at the tube his eyes were dark agitated he licked the corner of his mouth with the tip of his tongue this made him seem like a cornered animal how could you help but he was in the front seat there was glare the hell there was glare pellams face flushed you think im covering up something im not i described the guy who bumped into me oh thats mighty brave of you i saw him we dont need his description anyway hes rabbited he was just the hired gun and hes back in miami or chicago by now do you think they paid me off i think youre like everybody else you dont want to get involved pellam sighed i better be going i think when you look in the front seat of a car you fucking see somebody i thinkwhen you move your mouth youre talking to somebody i wasnt you saw him i saw you look right into his face if you saw so damn much why the hell didnt you see him how much did they pay you i didnt listen mister buffett blurted viciously youre gonna have cops on your ass every minute of the day theyre going to stay on you theyre not going to let you crap until you tell pellam waved his hand in frustration and walked to the door you son of a bitch buffetts face was livid tendons rose in his neck and flecks of spittle popped from his lips his voice choked and for a moment pellam feared he was having a heart attack when he saw that buffett was simply speechless with rage he himself stormed out of the door and walked squarely into a young woman as she entered sorry he muttered she blinked and stepped aside timidly oh im sorry the woman was thin blond late twenties dressed unflashy like an executive secretary looking shy and embarrassed pellam assumed she was the cops wife and thought he was lucky to be married to someone so pretty he also thought she was going to have to put up with pure hell for a long long time she said im looking for dr albertson pellam shook his head shrugged and walked past her in the hall he heard buffett shouting to him sure so just leave just like that go ahead you son of a bitch the voice faded as he proceeded down the corridor the cop on guard said something too something pellam didnt hear though from the snide smile on his face he guessed it was no friendlier than the cops farewell then he was at the elevator kneading his hands and feeling his jaws clench with anger he punched the down button seven times before he realized it had lit up and the car was on its way a womans voice startled him im sorry i didnt mean to barge in he glanced back and saw the blond woman walk up looking at the floor indicator pellams mouth tightened no problem he looks familiar she glanced back up the corridor who well your friend the man in the room you were just in dont you know him she explained that she didnt she was looking for her mothers doctor and the nurse had sent her there she nodded toward the room who is he pellam said hes the cop the one that got shot oh sure the postdispatch they ran his picture whats his name donnie buffett hes your friend pellam waved his hand what you heard back there i dont think youd call him much of a friend the elevator arrived they both stepped in behind them stood a man in a dressing gown his hand grasping a tall iv bag on wheels like a chrome hat rack the doctors left for lunch already she grimaced i was supposed to meet him here about mother now ive got to come back in an hour your mothers a patient hysterectomy shes fine well shes complaining nonstop but that means shes fine the elevator slowly filling with her fruity perfume arrived on the ground floor so he said as they walked outside into the cool air of the spacious lobby well my names john pellam she took his hand nina sassower they walked out the front door of the hospital and nina surveyed the street she had a great profile the lines of her face were what came to mind unencumbered then he smiled ruefully to himself unencumbered too much movie talk too much artistic vision no shes sensuous shes pretty shes sexy pellam looked at his watch he had a lot to do and not much time to do it ingetting the insurance binders for the bungalows running his daily check on the dozens of shooting permits to make sure they hadnt expired during this elongated filming schedule calling his bank in sherman oaks about the mortgage to finance his own film central standard time seeing what other markers he had that he might call inand all the while dodging cops what he did though was none of these things instead he asked you interested in lunch and as it turned out she was at three that afternoon pellam was in the camper about to ride to the set when his phone buzzed he snagged it and propped it between his shoulder and his cocked head as he pulled on his leather jacket lo dinner tomorrow okay is that you marty heres the deal you ready telorian pellam did not speak for a moment are you sure ugh am i sure weller repeated sarcastically ahmed telorian the fiftyyearold armenianiranian investor after the hostage thing he began calling himself persian had grown to love american movies as much as he loved making millions from electronic component sales telorian and his wife had bought gutted and renovated an old theater in westwood they had turned it into a cult stronghold in which they showed oddball films many of them film noir john pellams forte telorian and pellam had spent an evening together several years ago drinking and talking about claire trevor and gloria grahame and robert mitchum and ed dmytryk they argued vocally and with white knuckles around their thick glasses of ouzo the reason for that meeting several years ago was telorians other avocationproducer of lowbudget films he had read pellams central standard time and was interested in optioning it this happened to be at a time when pellam had not wished to have anything to do with film companies except location scouting a generous offer of option money was rejected and telorian had huffed away from the meeting pellam had not thought about him since then he now felt his pulse increase a few tempos as he asked hes in maddox more likely to see elvis hustling for a table at the hard rock cafe he happened to be in chicago my secretary tracked him down you kind of blew him off a few years ago he says i blew everybody off a few years ago its not like hes taking it personally not too personally he still thinks central standard can be a hit hes got to be home day after tomorrow but i got him to agree to stop over in st louis to talk to you what does he feel about me directing not a problem he just wants to know how youd do it times arent as flush as they used to be hes interested in hits he doesnt mind a grainy film but it has to be hit grainy film got it whens his plane get in whenever he tells his pilot to land meet us at eight at the waterfront sheraton lobby bar you know where it is i can find it about forty fifty minutes from maddox hes got the treatment the script pellam asked hes got everything all you need to bring is as much tony sloan gossip as you can dig up in the floralwallpapered entryway was a white formica table on it rested a lucite pitcher filled with plastic flowers to the left through an arched doorway was a parlor the furniture in the rooms was mostly s chain storekidneyshaped tables blond wood chairs wingbacks and love seats upholstered in beige a lot of plastic plastic everywhere in the corner of the parlor was a young woman in a white blouse and black pedal pushers struggling through a chopin etude a young muscular man in brown slacks and yellow shortsleeved shirt leaned against the piano smiling at her and nodding slowly when i first saw you you know it was the night of the dance it was i remember she stopped playing and looked up it was hot as a inline block you were across the room under that japanese lantern that lantern it was the one that was busted sure it was busted and the bulb shone through that paper and covered you in light thats when i knowed you was the girl for me he put his hand on hers a heavyset man appeared slowly in the doorway he lifted a thompson submachine gun the couple turned to him their smiles vanished no the woman screamed the man started forward toward the assailant the gun began its fierce rattling pictures vases lamps exploded black holes popped into the wall bloody wounds appeared on the bodies of the couple as they reached toward each other as the magazine in the submachine gun emptied and a throbbing silence returned the couple slowly spiraled to the floor their slick bloody hands groping for each others their fingers touched the bodies lay still none of the fifteen or so sweaty people standing in the room around the immobile bloody bodies said a single word no one moved most of them were not even staring at the couple but were looking instead at the bearded man in jeans and green tshirt who leaned against a reflector stand his red eyes dancing pensively around the room tony sloan paced over the spent machinegun cartridges he was shaking his head the man in brown sat up wiped blood off his nose and said come on tony it works cut came the shout from behind the camera the bloody actress jumped to her feet and slapped her sticky palms on her hips oh christ she muttered viciously sloan stepped closer to the carnage surveying it he spat out it doesnt work the machine gunner pulled cotton out of his ears and said whats he say the actress grimaced he says it doesnt work the killer shrugged sloan motioned to danny the script writer and the assistant director a young blond woman in her early thirties the three of them huddled in the corner of the room while wardrobe and grips spread out onto the set cleaning up we gotta shoot it outside sloan said the assistant directors golden ponytail swaggered as she nodded vigorous approval outside danny sighed according to the writers guild contract he was paid a great deal of money every time he revised missouri river blues the fun of making that money however had long ago worn off its not you know dynamic enough sloan mused we need a sense of motion they should be moving i think its important that they move danny pulled his earplugs out if you remember the book and if you remember the shooting script they escaped i didnt kill them in the first place the director said no no no i dont mean that theyve got to die i just think they should get killed outside you know like it suggests theyre that much closer to freedom remember rosss fear fear of the lockdown the assistant director recited shaking her stern blond ponytail it was impossible to tell if she was speaking with reverence or sarcasm danny wound his own ponytail the color of a ravens wings around stubby fingers then touched from his cheek a fleck of red cardboard from the blank machinegun shells he looked as exhausted as sloan tell me what you want tony you want them dead ill make them dead you want them dead outside ill make them dead outside just tell me the director shouted pellam shit did he leave pellam who had not been wearing earplugs but had been sitting on the front hall stairs thirty feet away from the shooting stood up and walked into the living room he dodged bits of pottery and glass and stepped over two arms assistants in protective gear who were removing several of the explosive gunshotimpact squibs that had failed to detonate sloan asked him what about a road why do you want a road id like them to die on a road sloan said or at least near a road the actress in pedal pushers said i dont want to get shot again its loud and its messy and i dont like it youve got to die sloan said quit complaining about it with a bloody finger she pointed to the cartridge of film the assistant photographer was pulling off the panaflex camera im dead its in the can the director stared at the ground what id like is to find a road going through woods no a field a big field maybe beside a school or something ross and dehlia are planning one last heist but its an ambush the pinkerton guys stand up in the window suddenly out of the blue pellam began to say something will you stop with that bonnie and clyde shit already pellam sloan snapped thisll be different everybody thinks theyre going to get shoti mean the audience is thinking bonnie and clyde theyre thinking theyve seen this before but uhuh here the lads get away maybe the guns dont go off and danny said neither of the guns go off there are two agents well one gun jams and the other guy misses so now you want them to live danny asked brightly no no no i want them to escape then get killed maybe in a freak accident ive got it they drive into a train the actress said if i dont get shot again i dont mind pellam said somebody else did a train crash ending who was it thats very seventies elliott gould mightve driven a car into a train once or donald sutherland sugarland express he wondered why he was getting so riled missouri river blues wasnt his movie the stoolie from the studio a young man with curly hair not tied in a ponytail lit a cigarette and said to no one in particular you know what it costs to rent a train sloan started to speak then reconsidered he said i could go with a tractortrailer maybe pellam said why dont you rename the film and call it daughter of bonnie and son of clyde danny slapped pellams palm five high the director ignored them daniel rewrite it and lets get john a copy i want it to look like theyre going to get blasted but then something happens and they escape and theres a freak accident exasperated danny said what what happens tell me give me a clue the director said surprise me i want it like man cant touch them but fate can fate or nature or some shit pellam asked you want any particular land of road a road his eyes began to fly again i want it near the river and i want a big field on one side i want the car to careen into the river the river pellam grimaced it was often impossible to get permits for scenes like that nowadaysno one wanted gas and oil and random car parts filling up their bodies of water many of the car crash setups were guerrilla shotswithout a permit in and out before the authorities found out the evidence left at the bottom of the river or lake pellam guessed that if sloan insisted on launching rosss packard into the missouri river it would have to be a guerrilla shot sloan said im going to look at rushes he hurried toward the door before he could leave though the sound of arguing voices rose from the hallway a security guard was backed onto the set by two tall men in light gray suits they walked steadily toward him speaking low and pleasantly but insistently one of the men looked at pellam he saidto his partner thats him they turned from the flustered redfaced guard and strode onto the set hey hey hey sloan said what is this john pellam before pellam could answer sloan said impatiently this is a closed set youll have to leave one said in a high contrite voice im sorry for the intrusion this wont take a moment he turned to pellam youre john pellam thats right sloan looked at pellam with a mixture of perplexity and anger in his face john who are these guys whats going on here like the cops the day before these men ignored sloan and said to pellam were with the federal bureau of investigation ids appeared and like the day before when the cops had shown up everyone on the set stopped working and turned to watch im special agent monroe and this is special agent bracken would you mind stepping outside with us wed like to ask you a few questions the agents ignored the bloody actress perhaps they had seen a lot of machinegunned bodies in their day about what a crime you may have been a witness to if you have a few minutes now i really dont yessir bracken said monroe with his razorcut hair and tidy mustache looked like an fbi agent bracken was scruffy and had a wrinkled suit he looked like a thug maybe he worked undercover it wont take long hes very busy sloan said were all very busy bracken spoke to pellam as if he had uttered this protest well sir the thing is if you continue not to cooperate well have to take you to st louis and sloan strode over to them i dont know what this is all about but you cant just walk in here go get a warrant or something john what the hell is going on here what are they talking about well we can get a warrant sir but thatll be to arrest mr pellam here for what contempt and obstruction of justice now if thats how youd like us to proceed jesus sloan whined closing his eyes he sounded more upset than pellam talk to them john he waved his hand fiercely as if scaring away a bee this is not a problem i want you understand me maybe if we could just step outside mr pellam monroe said it shouldnt take long sloan lifted impatient eyebrows at pellam and told the agents hed be happy to seven pellam preceded the two agents out of the house past a row of location vans dollies and generator trucks then down the street they kept motioning him along the sidewalk away from the curious eyes of the cast and crew and the crowd of locals who stared with fascination at the equipment and occasionally wavedsome timidly some like relativesat the cast one middleaged man pointed at pellam and whispered something to the woman by his side their faces seemed to darken and they stared unsmiling as he walked out of sight behind a row of shaggy hedges when he turned as directed into an alley between two empty houses he could glimpse the couple again they still stared with apparent hostility and several others had joined them halfway through the alley which pellam thought led to the agents car the two men stopped one on either side of him we can talk here here pellam stepped back to put some distance between him and the agents he brushed against the brick wall of one of the houses he turned and found himself hemmed in pellam turned back to bracken couldnt we shut up barked the unscruffy monroe bracken pointed a stubby finger at pellams chest and pushed him hard against the wall we know he got to you we know hes pulling your dick though they both shaved bracken had done the sloppier job of it he smelled of sweat no aftershave for these boys grimfaced pellam waved his arm in the air and started toward the mouth of the alley you can go to hell two huge fists suddenly grabbed his shoulders and slammed him back into the wall his head bounced against the window which cracked under the impact were not getting through to you monroe said an unlicensed pistol in his waistband pellam did not want to be frisked he lifted his arms unthreateningly palms outward why dont you just tell me what this is all about a witness to a federal crime who refuses to testify or who fabricates testimony known to be false can be guilty of contempt obstruction of justice and perjury bracken wore a thick gold bracelet on his hairy wrist which seemed unbecoming on an agent of the federal government as well as conspiracy if a link can be shown between him and the primary perpetrator bracken lowered his face into pellams im talking about if you havent got the balls to tell us what you saw that night were looking at you as an accessory are you arresting me no sir then this is harassment i think its time i called my lawyer braken took him by the lapels again and shoved him back against the wall pellam remembered to keep his head tilted forward so he wouldnt break any more windows we know you saw crimmins in the lincoln and we want you to identify him i dont even know who youre talking about the man whos paying you off you dont remember him a surveillance photograph appeared from monroes pocket it had been lifted from a videotape and the time and date were visible in the righthand comer the picture showed a heavyset man with a broad slavic face and receding hairline his mouth was open and he was turning his head to speak to an unseen person walking behind him ive never seen him look again pellam thats peter crimmins i do not look again pellam monroe said hes the man who was in the lincoln hes the man responsible for the death of vincent gaudia and for the shooting of a maddox policeman hes the man you saw all we need is your confirmation i cant confirm what i didnt see youre not going to cooperate bracken barked this is cooperation listening to you two in fact its beyond cooperation im leaving it had been a long long hour peter crimmins was sweating his sea island cotton shirt was wet in the small of his back and under the arms the sweat would bead on his chest hair and when he moved would press cold against the skin sweat was gathering too in the deep folds of fat where his waist met his chest it trickled down his back crimmins knew that at any time he could have asked the agents to leave and then they would either have to let him go or arrest him but if they arrested him which they might easily have donethat meant he would have to have his friend and counselor present that was something crimmins didnt want so he had consented to the questioning he waved the men into seats in his office sandwiched between the parking lot and the room of dark desks and rested his fingertip on the mole above his eye the barrage of questions lasted for an hour they were handsome black men and looked more like recent business school graduates than federal agents they seemed wee many of crimminss clients both the legitimate ones and the less so clever polite reserved but underneath the personalities of a midwest dawn in january one asked the questions the other alternated between staring calmly at crimmins and taking notes could i ask you where you were last friday night sir he hated the sir the way it fell like a fleck of spit off the end of the sentence showed their contempt for him but what could he do that was an old rule in negotiationsnever say anything that can be quoted against you later if he later claimed harassment the agent would say i never called him anything but sir look at the transcript i was at my office most of the night until when about ten quarter to maybe by yourself yes my secretary leaves at fivefifteen every night i stay late a lot of times is there a guard we got guards sure but i didnt see any of them that night when i left is there any way of confirming your whereabouts you really think i killed vince gaudia crimmins asked exasperated is there any way of confirming it sir the agent repeated no do you own a lincoln yes and a mercedes wagon a diesel what color is the lincoln crimmins rubbed the bump of his third eye why did they hate him so dark blue but you know that already dont you whats the license number he gave it to them where was that car on the night weve been talking about crimmins was hungry he had bouts of low blood sugar if he didnt eat regularlysometimes five meals a dayhe would have attacks he thought with some pleasure that vince gaudia never got to eat his last meal the night he died i drove it into the city and parked it where sir the place i always park it the garage near the ritz and thats a lincoln continental i told you that already actually no we dont know what model is it a continental its a town car now tell me again where you were on that night crimmins asked where i was sitting you mean you were in your office you claim im not claiming i was there i told you that didnt he write it down i saw him write it down why wasnt your secretary there she leaves about fivefifteen every day i told you that too the interview went on and on and on and the agents picked over every word that crimmins said finally the men stood they flipped their notebooks closed and gathered their raincoats suddenly they were gone he now sat at his desk staring at the familiar nicks along the side running his finger over them feeling the bulge of his gut against his belt the phone rang his lawyer was on the line grimmins decided not to tell him about the visit from the fbi it had been worse than expected but if he told the lawyer the man would have a tantrum that he had spoken to the agents alone but the issue didnt come up the lawyer wanted to talk not listen pete ive got some news call me on a safe phone will you crimmins grunted and hung up he walked down stairs and up the street to the ritz carlton parking garage without proffering a ticket he nodded to a young attendant who scurried off to retrieve the lincoln crimmins looked at it sourly as it rolled up he gave the boy a bill then got inside and drove out onto the broad street he lifted the receiver of the car phone the number of which was changed so frequently that he was percent sure it was a secure line news you said crimmins drove leisurely well under the speed limit the witness the nonfriend and counselor said yes the witness to the gaudia hit i know thats what you mean what about him crimmins snapped angry because there was a percent chance the line was not secure i found him how i called some favors in called in favors nonsense nobody owes a leech any favors who is it a man with this movie company thats up in maddox movie company i never heard about a movie company theyre shooting some gangster film up there his voice was bright with an irony that crimmins didnt wish to acknowledge well tell me about him the man said they know he saw who was in the car both maddox police and the fbi so far hes been too scared to testify what did he see crimmins asked slowly theyre sure he saw the driver the lawyer said then added theres something else i should tell you i heard from somebody in the justice department that petersons going after him hes going to jump on this guy with both feet hes going to jump on him until he burns you a sigh whats his name john pellam wheres he staying the lawyer hesitatedpehaps at crimminss sudden interest in details then he said hes got a trailer you know a camper he parks it different places but mostly hes staying at the old trailer camp by the river in maddox near the cement plant i thought that was closed maybe for the movie people they opened it its deserted around there isnt it now the hesitation grew into a long silence the lawyer managed to ask why do you want to know that tell me peter crimmins said i dont need anything more from you for the time being line it up for me nels said ronald l peterson the us attorney for the eastern district of missouri he sat in a large office done up in functional sixties design the furniture was expensive the desk was solid teak but you could not tell by looking at its top which was covered with a thousand pieces of paper on the bookshelves filling three walls were dark wilted volumes moores federal practice digest federal sentencing guidelines federal rules of civil procedure case reporters law reviews aba journals young nelson sandyhaired solid a purebred preppy opened a file stuffed full of scraps of yellow foolscap and began pulling out sheets and organizing them peterson fortyfour was wearing a brooks brothers navy suit about onefifth as old as he a white shirt a yellow tie with black dots on it a summer model technically but this was his goodluck tie having been around his neck when he put seven cosa nostra leaders into prison and so he wore it whenas nowhe felt he needed luck peterson was a solid man with thick hands and a smooth face balding a roll of belly and midriff that showed taut and pinkish under the thin white shirts he always wore he was the sort of man whose face revealed exactly the boy he had been at thirteen and in other ways too he was much the same then as now confident vindictive smart determined prissy and manic ronald peterson s approach to this job as well as his approach to the practice of law was characterized by an almost charming simplicity he was the chief us lawyer in a major judicial district for the same reason he had worked in the justice department for the past nine years because he thought that people who did bad things ought to go to jail years ago in law school troubled about what kind of practice to go into peterson had heard one of his harvard law professors say that the best lawyers make the worst judges meaning that the practice of law provides its own moralitylawyers do not need to make terrifying judgments about right and wrong they just apply the rules this observation was an epiphany for him and that summer he took a job as an intern in the same us attorneys office that he now headed he had been applying the simple rules ever since he went about this task with the devotion of a fundamentalist shiitewith whom he shared a sense of righteousness and an ecstatic appreciation of the abstract the man who was the focus of petersons present jihad was peter crimmins this campaign actually had less to do with the infamous minutes program skewering his office than one might think no what peterson resented so much about crimmins was what the prosecutor had identified as a serious problem in americaa legitimate businessmans cool conscious decision to move into illegal activities crimmins like the insider traders whom peterson also loathed had simply found the profits at his trucking businesses not up to his greed and had expanded into money laundering and other crimes as if that were the next logical step in market expansion nelson an assistant us attorney had reviewed all the sheets of foolscap he looked into his bosss adolescent eyes its dicey his voice stopped abruptly and he immediately regretted the word peterson continually told his people not to give soft assessments he wanted specifics yeses and nos peterson was renowned for his temper tantrums but today he was not in the mood to beat up anyone for casual lapses like this he drank more of his coffee and asked what do we know about crimmins the night of the hit he denies it all but hasnt got an alibi we didnt have a tail on him but there were no phone intercepts in or out for two hours on either side of the shooting he does have a lincoln match circumstantial both the getaway and crimminss are darkcolored but theres no tag or other id not yet crimminss got that bodyguard doesnt he yep but he doesnt match the id of the gunman what about earlier wiretaps peterson wondered was there a syllable that might be taken to suggest crimmins was ordering a hit was there some talk of accidents anything about oh cleaning house there had not been nelson reported as he stroked his young pink cheek under which several teeth seemed to chew nervously on his tongue he added but you know how tough surveillance has been crimmins makes half his calls from the park and his car phone a serene peterson spun in his functional s chair and licked a smear of coffee off the side of his cup losing the star witness on whom he had pinned so much hope had been such a blow that it transcended simple rage besides a measure of such anger as peterson might feel had no target other than himself for acquiescing to gaudias flippant request to keep the us marshals out of his hair the us attorney breathed slowly as he looked out over the city but would crimmins really have been present at the hit why maybe they had been meeting maybe crimmins was trying to cut a deal with gaudia and the talks had turned sour peterson patted his thighs he was on a diet one of the things that irked him was that he looked like peter crimmins only crimmins had more hair his head turned slowly but powerfully as if it were geared at a very low ratio what about the witness whats his name pellam the cops arent sharing anything with us pricks peterson spat out he slapped his leg feeling the fat reverberate one of theirs gets shot and the mayor and commissioner sit on the witness you know why they do that for the postdispatch thats why they do it whos on him monroe and bracken rousted him good but hes not talking youre sure he got a peek yep no way he couldve missed him impossible i think its a payoff i think so too nelson said though he in fact did not what he believed was that crimmins had said simply if you talk ill kill you and pellam had been struck dumb peterson said move on it big find out everything you can about him who crimmins which nelson realized to his dread was an immensely stupid question he said quickly oh you mean pellam uhm then tell them monroe and bracken peterson mused absently gazing at a avindup toy on his desk have them beat him up what nelson whispered petersons eyes flickered and landed on his assistants troubled face figuratively he added casually keep on him i mean you knew i meant that didnt you figuratively nelson said sure i knew eight pellam realized suddenly that he had known nina sassower for twentyfour hours and had no idea what she did for a living im unemployed actually she said in response to his question she was blushing and suddenly appeared very embarrassed pellam told her that hed been in films more than ten years and the majority of that time hed been unemployed they were walking through what was left of downtown maddox they had finished lunch and were moving at pellams tacit guidance away from the park where tony sloan was choreographing the murders of two pinkerton men who stumble on rosss hideout ninas narrow eyes darted uncomfortably at the sound of the gunshots they were makebelieve but still troubling pellam touched her arm to direct her toward the river today she wore a bulky orange vneck sweater the matching orange skirt was billowy and a brisk wind snapped it like a ships sail her shoes were tan and she carried a raincoat that was the same shade an improbable outfit on santa monica boulevard but in maddox missouri it was quite becoming when they had put some distance between them and the gunfight she relaxed before i got laid off i was a school counselor grade school pellam had taken those tests his teachers in the catskill town where he grew up were encouraging but the tests revealed he had relatively little aptitude for any of the listed careers because pellam liked to read the counselor suggested book salesman because he liked to go to movies the man offered usher then with hard work theater manager not a guidance counselormore of a therapist a psychiatrist psychologist but budget cutbacks illinois too all over the country i guess surprised they even have schools left in maddox well i really live in cranston which isnt as bad off as here closer to st louis but we still arent doing well anyway i guess if youre the one laid off it doesnt matter if unemployment is one percent or twenty guess not they looked straight down this broad street and saw the gray slab of river a quarter mile away despite a heavy network of overhead power and telephone cables the street seemed very nineteenthcentury like a deserted frontier towns it would look perfectly natural for the road to be filled with muddy mule teams and drovers and ponies and river workers slogging through the muck toward the docks pellam noticed a couple of scabby atmospheric buildings right out of let me take some snaps hold up a second a battered polaroid camera unfolded and he took four pictures he stuffed the undeveloped moist squares into his shirt then continued on nina beside him are those for your movie not the one theyre shooting now i have a catalog of buildings and places that directors might want keeps me from reinventing the wheel every time i get a call you work for the studio or do you have your own business freelancer like most everybody here nowadays the studios just finance and distribute everybody else is hired as an independent contractor used to be different in the thirties and forties the studios owned your soulif you had a soul that is she didnt laugh but seemed to be memorizing this lesson in hollywood enterprise and so he decided not to make a casting couch joke not yet he turned back to the old buildings and nina watched him take more pictures whats that your catalog of locations pellam stored the binders in a file box under his bed in the camper he said that can be arranged they continued up the street lets go in can we nina nodded at a store although pellam was extremely aware that he owed sloan a big field he said sure they walked into a huge warehouse filled with scavenged relics from buildings nina said she was interested in columns and mantelpieces they found a couple of scabby wooden columns stripped down carelessly you could still see blotches of paint and nicks and the scorch marks from the blowtorch nina liked them but thought at four hundredeach they were too pricey pellam agreed he also did not think they would fit into his california contempo bungalow on beverly glen and dangerous he added in the camper she smiled at this then stopped in front of a dark flaking mirror framed in ancient oak she flicked her hair with her ringers pellam asked tell me about yourself she blushed and gazed at a brass coal bucket with a face embossed into it a cherub pellam commented not pushing the deflected question i always thought that was a cigar like the kind clint eastwood smoked in those italian westerns isnt that cheroot could be im always getting things mixed up after a pause she said in a dogged voice so tell you about myself well she had apparently steeled herself for the response youll probably find it pretty boring i grew up in maddox went to mizzouthats the university of missouriin st louis studied english lit which gets you nowhere i got a job in a library and didnt like where it was going so i got a masters degree in psychology then moved over to cranston nice safe distance from mom and at the time dad hobbies astrology shiatsu massage he thought quickly was it too early in their courtship to make a thigh reference probably he opted for back he said i have this problem in my back then added my lower back she parried with feigned disappointment i dont do lower backs you specialize i see he waited what he thought was the proper amount of time no boyfriend boyfriend she considered and he wondered if she was tailoring a lie theres this guy i see off and on a lot off and not much on you know how it is when i was younger i dated a lot but i dont know something about mei was kind of a jerk magnet what rocks those boys crawled out from under ever been married no you he was a veteran pellam admitted see id rather not get married than be married and have to go through the pain of divorce well pellam said without pain theres no appreciation they both considered that while they stared at a ninetydollar spittoon he said youre thinking that was a stupid thing to say nina was nodding uhm yeah i think it was she laughed and they paused at bins filled with old albums selling for fifty cents each pellam liked the scratchy sound of lps he didnt own a cd player he sunk a lot of his listening money into records when he got home hed record them on cassettes for the tape deck in the winnebago he began going through the jazz bin you like music oh yeah music is the best she announced and looked over his shoulder at the album cover he was reading whos that she asked oscar peterson whos that sounds familiar oscar peterson pellam said again uh im land of into soft rock you know light fm its relaxing oh its jazz he said like stevie wonder nina asked sincerely sort of pellam said they use the same notes outside the voodoo of tony sloans paranoia caught up with pellam he explained that he had to get back to work when he leaned forward to kiss her cheek to say goodbye she responded with firm pressure on his hands and even leaned into him a semihug he glanced down and got a clear vision of the plunging neckline of her sweater he was staring at her pale skin when they separated and she caught his downwardlooking eyes he said quickly i was admiring those earrings theyre interesting a present she said perhaps choosing not to believe him he slipped on his sunglasses and smiled you interested in searching for a field with me sometime nina nodded sure id like that she touched his arm and looked serious but id like to say something the boyfriend who wasnt a boyfriend the girlfriend who was a girlfriend i dont like men with film companies lips that touch liquor yup i want to tell you why i picked you up hows that i mean not that i dont like you no see i heard that when the film company came to town they were hiring people i mean its not the only reason i started talking to you is there any way i could get a job well he should have known this was hardly the first time it had happened she must have seen the flicker in his eyes the raybans were not all that dark im sorry her eyes went straight to the ground i shouldnt have asked its just i dont mind its just that ive been out of work for six months i havent even been able to find a job waitressing he touched the incredibly soft orange alpaca over her muscular arm the thing is shootings almost over all the extras have been cast and they dont make much money anyway no no no her face had turned pink i wouldnt want to act i dont even like movies i think theyre stupid she doesnt like movies oh everybody likes movies well what did you have in mind i dont know i see so many people in town from your company thirtyseven cast members from hollywood sixtytwo local extras seventyone labased crew members sixtyseven from st louis twelve stuntmen eight drivers two producers two caterers two animal wranglers one stoolie from the coast one hightech visionary director one location scout is there pellam asked anything you can do nina considered this for a minute the blush was gone and so was her bashfulness he suspected that beneath the wan julia roberts face was a ballbuster of a school counselor i cant really do anything other than coach girls gymnastics and talk to students pellam squeezed her arm again and he said you can make yourself beautiful she sniffed a laugh youre flirting no i have something in mind pellam said then he added in addition to flirting missouri river blues scene ainterior day rosss getaway car contd ross when first saw you you know it was the night of the dance it was dehlia holding wounded arm i remember ross it was hot as a inline block you were across the room under that japanese lantern angle on dehlia hair flying in the breeze she looks back with love in her eyes dehlia gasping that lantern it was the one that was busted ross sure it was busted and the bulb shone through that paper and covered you in light thats when i knowed you was the girl for me ouch thats terrible dont read anymore pellam stile and pellam sat on a river bluff overlooking the missouri pellam was looking down at the revised script he recited emotionally you was the girl for me pellam stile said wincing please thats what they say just before they skid into the river dont you think thats purty the hole in thelanterns a metaphor for freedom you know whats a metaphor to keep the cows in in this case stile nodded toward the script its where the bullshit is ill bet in the final scene the cops find the car but not the bodies pellam flipped to the end and read damn damn damn im right gimme five stile and pellam slapped palms and the stuntman limped over to the yamaha he had spent the afternoon getting shot with a at close range and tumbling down a flight of stairs thirty gunshots and fifteen falls then sloan had changed his mind and decided stile should fall through a window after getting shot but the stunt coordinator insisted they postpone the scene till tomorrow and gave stile the rest of die day off he had joined pellam and together they spent the afternoon driving around on the cycle looking for sloans big field who was that squeeze i saw you with nina sassower pellam joined stile at the cycle well thats a name and a half i havent seen her around thats because this is her first day on the set i got her a job doing makeup shes pretty good at it shes also pretty good at kissing and throwing her arms around you it was true she had been casting couch is one thing pellam if you get laid cause you got somebody a job as a makeup artist while i fall out of tall buildings and have to content myself with ring around the rosy at night there is no justice in this world pellam was not however thinking of nina sassower and her embracing arms he was obsessed with getting the field the houses and buildings for the film had been easy maddoxs economic condition being what it was the field was another story it needed a border of dense trees a road a river and a school in a stand of bushes also a small cliff for the dramatic crash the best they had found was a small overhang beside a weedy pumpkin patch to reach the bluff for its dramatic fall rosss packard would have to crash through deep thickets of forsythia and juniper and maple saplings very vegetative place this missouri pellam observed and oddly short on fields i still dont see why youre working for sloan even a whores got principles sort of oil and water is what im saving pellam wiped beads of dew off the face of his casio six pm he had to meet marty weller and ahmed telorian in two hours lets have a beer call it quits he sat in the saddle of the yamaha stile pocketed the polaroid and climbed on behind the wind rose up in sudden chill bursts the rain had mostly stopped but the streets were flecked with its aftermathbits of bark and branchesand the air was very damp a dog with fur spiked by an earlier downpour walked up to them sniffed belligerently then fled as pellam kicked over the engine they sped onto the asphalt i called hank pellam shouted over the roar referring to the cardplaying attorney retained by the film company he said theres nothing i can do about it those fbi guys you mean they can interview whoever they want they can stop production they can look at all our permits they can go to delaware and sacramento and look at everything the companys ever filed wooee tonys gonna roast your nuts boy hed just fire me is what hed do pellam said i dont think he can fire you for not testifying ill bet you can sue him if he tries yeah right pellam motioned toward the river a mule team of barges slapped through the water beside them the wind was up and sailors were huddled on the pushing tug deckhands stood on the front of the barge wearing orange vests and speaking into walkietalkies presumably to the captain who stood three football fields behind in the pilot house he wore a suit and tie stile watched it and shouted i love riverboats yessir eighteen fiftythree the altona made the run from st louis to alton in one hour and thirtyfive minutes see the lights thats alton how do you know this stuff pellam shouted back over the rattle of the engine nobody beat that record for a while well the robert e lee couldve of course or the natchez watch the curve there pellam looked back at the road just in time to make the curve with a skid that didnt even make stile flinch they turned off river road and shot toward downtown the lights were gassy and brilliant in the mist see he shouted to stile glare everywhere how could i see anything pellam pulled into the discount package store and killed the engine they walked into the greenneonlit store went to the cooler and began fighting it out over canadian or american beer pellam lost the toss and stile snagged a sixpack of bud plunking it down into pellams hands gotta take a leak pellam paid for the beer and wandered outside he opened a can and sat on the yamaha sipping he looked over at the flat black strip of the river he softly whistled a few bars from across the wide missouri the siren remained silent until the car was directly behind him then it burst into an huge electronic howl the spotlight came on simultaneously pellam was so startled he dropped the beer spilling a good portion on his jeans goddamn he spun around and looked at the car the doors were opening and two men were coming toward him like gmen about to gun down dillinger the wasp detective and the italian detective oh nothem again look what you did pellam lifted an arm showing them the drenched levis the italian cop ignored the spill and grabbed pellams arm he cuffed bis wrist pellam stared at the silver chain what the other wrist got cuffed too are you doing you have the right to remain silent you have the right to an attorney it was the italian detective speaking if you cant afford one his partner took over one will be appointed for you if you waive your right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in court do you understand each of these rights pellam thought they somehow knew about the unregistered that was sitting below his butt in the toolbox of the yamaha do you understand these rights sure i understand them what am i being arrested for the wasp cop said sir we take drunk driving very seriously in our community pellam closed his eyes he shook his head well have to give you a breathalyzer test the italian detective said the wasp said but im afraid we dont have it with us the italian said on cue we better take him downtown whats going on here stile chewing on a piece of beef jerky walked out of the store im pellam began just stay out of this mister the wasp cop said ominously to stile being arrested for what for bullshit pellam called he looked at his watch it was sixtwenty look i have a very important meeting at eight i cant quiet no look ive got to meet a man in st louis they roughly dragged him to the squad car and with a furry italian hand on his head pushed him inside pellam called stile you gotta make a call for me you gotta call marty all right thats enough out of you the door slammed shut pellam kicked the front seat furiously hes a hairsbreadth away from resisting the italian cop said to nobody wheres the station stile asked im coming down there the cops climbed into the front seat one of them said its in the phone book look it up they drove off leisurely leaving stile with a strip of beef jerky in one hand and five cans of beer in the other nine listen said ralph bales stevie flom was listening okay the man is not happy they sat in a chain restaurant on big bend boulevard in st louis stevie drank decaf ralph bales was drinking tea bleached by two wedges of lemon it was all you can eat dont be shy spaghetti night around them fat families sat hunched over mounds of food not very happy at all stevie was a punk and rarely gave a shit who was happy and who was not except that this particular unhappy person owed him a lot of money so its my fault stevie said his voice shrill the table rocked as he leaned forward and he whispered what i was supposed to let a cop take you out ralph bales held a finger to his lips im not complaining lombro isnt you know rational he thought you shouldve shot the cop in the leg or something so they wouldnt be so concerned about it not the back yeah right shot him in the leg like its night and ive got a pussy gun and i shoot him in the leg and he feels a little bee sting and turns around and explodes my head with hollow points bullshit i mean bullshit the men did not know each other well they moved in different circles ralph bales was older fifteen years he was well connected on the riverfront and probably could have been more of a mover except he ran into some trouble in chicago working for the giancana family some money that was supposed to find its way from cicero up to oak park had not made that short journey ralph bales remained alive to pay it back out of his salary but his name was suspect in chicago ever after so he returned broke to his hometown of st louis and found his way into riverfront services and cargo and trucking and finally became a consultant ralph bales had in fact been doing some security consulting when he met stevie flom a mutual friend needed some partners to help some expensive scotch fall off a truck and to move the cases after they touched down the job went smoothly though ralph bales had been irritated by arrogant stevie he found however that another person resided inside the young man desperate stevie who had worked up such incredibly large debts giving his money to casinos and to poker players and to the skirts he humped nightly it seemed that he would do whatever he was told to provided he was paid for it its my fault youre saying suddenly its all my fault youre not listening ralph bales said im just telling you the weather was cold and wet but stevie wore a sleeveless tank top he had good muscles he liked to show them off weve got to handle lombro handle him stevie exploded again though the detonations were softer because he was lifting his coffee to his lips what the hell does that mean first what it means is we dont get paid dont get paid back to the high decibels lombro was in the audience too he shouldve been looking out for heat he shoulda honked the horn or something fuck several parents worried about their chubby offspring glanced ominously toward the table ralph bales leaned forward look listen look you sound like a crossing guard this man is nobody to fool around with well you look im out five thousand dollars whichive been asking around all rightand i find is pretty on the low side for a hit ralph bales had told stevie that lombro was paying them ten thousandnot twentyfiveto split between them he looked at the young man with steely eyes whove you been talking to he asked in a menacing voice stevie stopped exploding he looked down at his cup and poured more cream into it nobody i mean i was just asking around you know but i didnt mention anything specific ralph bales sighed jesus dont say anything to anyone ever anything anyone ever lombro has connections you wouldnt believe deals connections stevie rolled his eyes he was speaking softly now though the look in ralph baless eyes had spooked him okay heres the arrangement we take care of the witness and lombroll pay us everything plus twentyfive percent well why didnt you just finish it the other day by the river we couldve waited okay think about it ralph bales said slowly well think about it stevie was too cool and too much of a punk to show admiration but his smile blossomed i get it you wanted to like goose lombro for more money you just you know go ahead and do things ralph bales lectured i thought it out twentyfive percent stevie tried to figure the numbers what was one quarter of five thousand fifty percent is twentyfive hundred then half of that he got lost ralph bales said means you walk away with close to seven thousand bucks not bad for two days work close to seven stevie smiled he didnt want to but he grinned ralph bales smiled too hey does your buddy ralph take care of you right okay stevie said i guess its all right when when what when do we do it well i was thinking about that i think we ought to wait a day or two make lombro think that were earning the money ill call him from time to time and tell him were close like weve almost found him but we arent sure another grin of near admiration on stevies face aimed down into the beige coffee then it faded and stevie said but what if you know the asshole decides to talk to the rucking cops what if excuse me gentlemen a shadow loomed over them a large man his gray hair closecropped muscular shoulders in a starched plaid shirt gazed somberly at the men he looked exactly like an undercover detective ralph baless doughy face burned and he felt the exact spot where his colt rested on his hip his hand eased toward it as he scanned the three or four dozen families surrounding them his heart began to pound and it pounded faster when he saw stevie flom looking up at the man with a belligerent grin on his face oh man grimfaced the man said like to ask you a question would you now stevie tossed the words at the tall figure whatd that be dont do anything stupid stevie i got my children over there he nodded toward a nearby table would you mind watching your language a bit i dont know where youre from but we dont talk hat way around here stevies grin vanished and his eyes flared his hand disappeared under the table where he undoubtedly lad his oh jesus lord ralph baless face popped out in sweat he leaned brward suddenly reaching for stevies arm but the young mans hand emerged with his napkin he wiped his mouth carefully and said im mighty sorry mister been a hard day terrible trouble on the job thats all right now for myself i dont care its the kids i was thinking of he turned away to his back stevie commanded wait the man turned stevie paused a moment then said my friend hell apologize to you too grinning he looked at ralph bales who held stevies eyes for a minute then said to the grayhaired man accept my apologies surely do the swing of the car door the reflection of a streetlight hitting him in the face the momentum of the case of beer as he tried to grab it the heavy crash of glass on glass the grimacing face of the halfbald guy saying fuck you bending down and looking in the car seeing himself in the window of the car the beer hemorrhaging at his feet the lincoln pulling away thats what pellam told the detectives one thing he couldnt tell them was the one thing that could have gotten him sprung instantly and on the way to the meeting with marty weller and their potential partnerthe description of the driver of the lincoln how far away was the sheraton pellam wondered how long would it take to get there forty minutes he seemed to recall not that it would matter at this point the time was now ninethirty he sat in a small room in the maddox police department across an unsteady table were the two detectives this tiny room like the rest of the office stank of age old wood lysol mold sour paint the walls were sickly green and shaded incandescent bulbs hung down from the cloudy grimy ceiling on black wires in the main office of the station were a dozen desks only two of them were occupied and only three others showed any signs that they were used the drive to police headquarters seemed to take forever pellam now decided he shouldnt have told them about his meeting he was sure the cops had intentionally driven ten miles out of their way to take him to the station and make sure hed be late when hed been led in cuffed and scowling the four cops in the room looked up with eight resentful eyes the italian detective had crouched down in front of a cabinet opened the doors and begun pulling things out a sears catalog empty flowerpots a shotgun in a plastic bag stacks of memos nope cant find it charlie wheres that breathalyzer got to dunno they had searched for a few minutes more but it was a halfhearted exploration and they couldnt locate the machine were going to have to get one from the highway patrol shouldnt take moren an hour youll have to wait here till we do when theyd said that the time had been it is absolutely vital i get to my meeting pellam had growled well when people get arrested they dont always get what they want i am not drunk book me or release me this had prompted them to take pellam into the tiny canister of a room where he now sat they asked as long as they had some time what did he remember about the gaudia hit they told him he could make a phone call if hed give them one factjust oneabout the man in the lincoln this is a setup well whatever you want to call it its all completely legal the wasp said indifferently so why dont you just put on your thinking cap he gave them the story one more time and then said i want to see my lawyer thats it thats what you told us before my lawyer he said you arent being charged with anything we cant charge you with anything until you take the breathalyzer test you just i want a lawyer you justll have to wait the italian cop was angry at pellams impatience the wasp cop looked like he had an idea maybe as long as hes here he could do that picture i dont know pellam offered im probably too drunk ha give it a shot why dont you he tried to do an identikit composite of the man who had knocked into him as he spoke he gazed blankly at the words on the suspect description form hair kinky afro fade cornrows caesar processed scar tattoo words only tattoo unknown type limp pimpled pocked harelip lefthanded bushy eyebrows muscular stocking cap cowboy hat applejack turban no one was impressed with his composite drawing and the cops decided he was still being recalcitrant the h cop said you know nobodys come forward youre the only one who can help pellam was trying to remember their names who was the h cop hilbert hanson hearst weve done a tag check tag pellam asked the italian cop the g cop said license plates on other cars in the vicinity that night oh your supervisor i want to see him right now the wasp continued and it came up zip weve got no other witnesses hellman harrison the g cop asked somberly if pellam knew how many people were killed annually by drunk drivers pellam didnt know if he was supposed to answer or not hagedorn that was it now he just had the g cop to worry about giovanni pellam said wearily let me talk to my lawyer you cant talk to a lawyer the g cop said i have a right its in the constitution confront my accusers which pellam regretted immediately he sounded prissy and obnoxiouslike the bald spineless cia director tony sloan had cast as the villain in his first movie the cops looked at each other then back to him they seemed to be rolling their eyes although their pupils didnt move from his face the g cop said thats only if youre the defendant if im not a defendant then what am i doing here not very much the g detective said bitterly not very much at all pellam slammed his open palm on the desktop it hit with a sound that surprised even him the cops blinked but neither of them moved are you going to arrest me for standing nearby a motor vehicle and having a sip of beer or not if you cant find the killer pellam felt his heart sprinting you cant find any leads so youre blaming me hey through clenched teeth pellam said you go to your boss and you say itd be open and shut except theres this witness who hasnt got the balls to help us hes a gfy whatever the hell that is hagedom said is somebody paying you off the italian cop said thats a crime sir a serious crime and youll do hard time for that pellam knew about good cop bad cop from some films hed worked on this was a variation bad cop really bad cop another officer a young uniform stuck his head in the door cant find that breathalyzer anywhere sorry and mhp dont have one to spare well this is your lucky day pellam ive spent three hours in this hellhole thats not lucky well sir you couldve been in our lockup all these three hours which is a lot less pleasant than here pellam walked past them into the main room he asked the desk officer was there a guy here tall blond hair mustache yeah but he left sorry he left sorry pellam s voice rang out in a singsong we had a little mixup my fault i heard them boys talking about the highway patrol and not seeing you i thought theyd taken you there i sent your friend to the troop hq its over on a good piece forty fifty miles or so the voice added unemotionally sorry about that pellam closed his eyes and rubbed them could you give me a ride back to my camper afraid not sir since youre not a suspect or a witness or anything thatd be against regulations well could you call me a cab at least cab the officer laughed he was joined by chuckles from other cops in the room the last time maddox had a cab company was in what was it larry oh id guess it mustve been thats okay pellam said ill walk to your camper one cop called say thats a long walk another said couple miles easy ten he found a pay phone outside a closed deli and finally got the front desk yessir mr weller had waited in the lobby until nine then left with another gentleman they were going to dinner would this be mr pellam by any chance yes did he leave a message for me weller had pellam was to meet him at the templeton steak house at ninethirty an hour and a half ago where is that according to the young mans blithe directions it was a half hour from maddox im calling from a pay phone you wouldnt happen to have their number would you well i do were you thinking of having the steak what i was wondering if you were going to eat there or if you were going to meet mr weller because if you were going to meet mr weller he was leaving the restaurant at tenthirty he had an eleven oclock flight out of lambert field hes checked out thats right believe he mentioned a trip to london pellam sighed and the other gentleman mr telorian i believe he was flying to los angeles tonight i should say sir mr weller was pretty anxious to see you he asked a number of times at the desk if youd called pellam was staring at the number pad on the phone hello the pleasant desk clerk asked still here dont be too fast to pass up templetons for my money best tbone in the county you still want that number pellam declined he dug another quarter out of his pocket made a call and sat down on the curb a half hour later the headlights of stiles taurus swept around a curve and the car braked to a stop beside him it was the first car he had seen on this road all night what youre experiencing is called phantom pain like ghostbusters donnie buffett said the woman smiled buffett shook his head as he laughed at his own tiny joke mostly though he was studying her all right she was a doctor and she was a woman well buffett knew better than to think it was weird that dr weiser this famous sci specialist wasnt a man but he could not get over what kind of woman she was young early thirties a sleek pretty face short punky auburn hair a pug nose a chin dimple fingernails painted glossy white lipstick red as a stop sign under a white lab coat was a silk blouse printed with red and green and blue geometric shapes andin addition to dark stockings and black ankle boots that had hooks not eyes for the laces she wore a black leather skirt almost a miniskirt when shed entered the room the woman had stuck her hand out firmly shook his and said wendy weiser your sci doctor youre the cop right buffett had cocked his head brushed off the surprise and said hope you dont mind if i dont stand up there you go she had said todays men no chivalry to speak of then weiser had plopped down in a chair and started right off talking flashing her green eyes at him she repeated a lot of what dr gould had said she didnt use the word nonambulatory though her message was no better than his she explained the pain he had been feeling in his legs was common in sci trauma and was called phantom pain thats when he had made the ghostbusters comment now as buffett studied heroutfit weiser suddenly hopped up she strode to the dotir and swung it closed then returned there are rules but whats life without risks huh im a pretty safe man to be in a closed room with wouldnt you say i mean i cant exactly chase you around the room when i get a wheelchair you better watch out you and me well race someday she examined him with a curious smile sounds like the gunman didnt get your sense of humor hey doctor buffett looked overtly grave if youre gonna help me im gonna help you im gonna teach you to speak cop i say something wrong shooter im sorry not gunman oh you dont say gunman on tv they say gunman we say shooter or perp perp perpetrator perp thats great her eyes widened buffett did not for a minute believe this enthusiasm but he appreciated it anyway she added ill have to use that sometime perp would a perp also rob somebody like a burglar yup perp equals bad guy so my exhusband is a perp could be buffett said and while im giving you a lesson he doesnt shoot he smokes them or dusts them or he lays the hammer on somebody and if he tolls them he offs them or ices them or whacks or does them you have to learn all this in cop school huh its more your postgraduate work officer donnie and im wendy everybody calls me wendy she looked at him with mystified amused eyes donnie ive got to say that most people arent quite so chipper after theyve been through what you have he waved his arm vaguely toward his feet signifying his injury this goes with the job description youre not willing to accept it you dont sign on in the first place doesnt mean i like it could he really call her wendy she was a doctor then again she was wearing earrings in the shape of tiny hamburgers weiser opened her purse and took out a pack of cigarettes a lighter was stuffed efficiently into the cellophane wrapper of the pack you mind no she asked you want one no dont tell weiser said i dont work vice buffett realized he hadnt shaved since he had been in the hospital he guessed he looked like shit well that was her problem he didnt have to look at himself weiser pulled the gray chair closer inhaled deeply on the cigarette several times she crossed her legs and bent down to stub out the cigarette on her boot heel she dropped the butt in her pocket evidence she said she straightened up put both feet on the floor doctor ah she cocked an eyebrow wendy he corrected it seemed so real she raised an eyebrow the pain she stood up and opened the window to air the room out and returned to the chair he felt the cold air on his arms and face but he didnt feel it on his legs she said its both psychological and physiological amputees have the same sensation its real in the sense that pain is a subjective experience and what youre experiencing is just like any other pain but its phantom because you arent feeling a pain response to stimuli at the nerve endings say wasnt your wife going to be coming by she was a while ago shell be back tomorrow he tried to picture penny buffett and wendy weiser chatting at a barbecue or pba picnic it was impossible to imagine this scene weiser nodded well next time this is mostly a social visit donnie weve done a lot of tests and were going to do a lot more ill be talking to you more specifically about the results of those tests in the next couple days what id like to do now is just talk with you about your injury in general he looked away she shifted her chair casually so that she was closer to his line of vision he glanced at her and he felt compelled to hold her gaze i want to tell you what im going to do as your doctor and talk to you about what youre going to do for yourself fair enough she said first i want to do something i dont do with all my patients im going to tell you whats going to be going on in your mind over the next several months this is sort of likewhats that they say on wall streetinsider information normally this is what we doctors keep in mind as we work with our patients but you seem like somebody whos got a good handle on himself you look skeptical donnie ive had sci patients that wont even let me in the room for the first month after their trauma ive had vases thrown at me see this scar its from a dinner tray ive had patients who dont seem to see me they watch tv while im talking to them its as if im not even in the same room they dont acknowledge me they dont acknowledge their injury youre in a different league from them i cant ignore a woman in a leather skirt its in my genes or something i think were going to be a great team she then grew serious there are several stages of recovery im speaking of emotional recoveryin a trauma like youve experienced the first is shock its numbness emotional blockage its similar to what happens to the body with physical injury shock insulates die patient that can last up to two or three weeks after the incident im amazed but you seem to be out of this stage already that kind of snappy recovery is rare id guess youre already in phase two which is realization of whats happened youll start feeling anxiety panic fear a real bummer bummer my daughters language you have a daughter twelve dont believe it she deflected this with a polite smile what youre going to experience is that youre not real present we say that youll be quote unavailable psychologically and what would your daughter call it weiser considered zoned out probably a defense mechanism because youre going to start to feel awful but with you i have every reason to believe that itll be shortlived she pronounced it with a long i shortluived that sounded weird so he figured it was probably right he also guessed that between the punk earrings was a very very smart brain so that was the second phase he said whats the third quarter going to be like what we call defensive retreat youre going to believe that you can cure yourself or that youve come to accept your injury and it doesnt bother you youll miss therapy sessions youll do everything you can to avoid thinking about the accident oh by the way youll probably become an insufferable son of a bitch youll want to blame somebody for whats happened youll have a lot of anger in you kid i knew got hurt once bad we was diving off the docks and this kid from the neighborhood which is alton no kidding dr weiser said im from wood river ha land of lincolners in the show me state buffett snorted when i was marriedhe was a professor at wash uwe lived in clayton god i was glad to get out of there move back to the country you were telling me about this friend of yours just a kid he dived in the water buffett wondered if dived was the right word dove he wished hed said jumped and you know how high some of those piers are he hit a board he didnt see we got him out right away so he didnt drown but what happened was he went blind he hit the back of his head or something he tried to beat me up he said i shouldve seen the board he accused another kid of pushing the board under him finally he moved away he never came back or called he wondered what the point to the story was he looked for something concludingsomething to tie it into what she was sayingand fell silent weiser said were used to behavior like that its part of recovery you may get some of it right back from me i grew up with three brothers ive got kind of a short fuse myself sometimes she retrieved her cigarette from her pocket and broke away the crushed part she lit it again and drew three times then went through the extinguishing routine once again the fourth phase is where we get the work done youre going to come to understand whats happened the defenseswhether its anger or denial or rationalizationwill crumble and youll confront it i never did understand that word confront like deal with those arent words that mean a lot to me youre not there yet so you cant expect them to youll be in heavyduty physical therapy throughout this phase finally youre looking skeptical again are you listening the final phase is the coping phase in effect you accept whats happened and you reorganize your life around the way you are buffett laughed again yeah yeah ill be able to play the violin after the operation weisers smile faded and she leaned forward for an instant he was wholly unnerved by the eye contact but was compelled to return her gaze he felt electricity between them his scalp bristled and his heart suddenly pounded like a snare drum he felt a twitch of pain well phantom pain when he spoke it was not his own voice that he heard but one that was lower and more mature and calmer doctor i dont want you to think ive got a swollen head or anything but im a survivor i dont lose at anything ever getting into the police academy getting onto the varsity basketball team yeah even at five ten everything ive ever set my mind to do ive done well what happened to me is crap sure but im alive i got friends i got family his right hand curled into a fist and im going to get through this weiser sat back her pine green eyes neither cautious nor inspirational but immensely pleased it seemed as if by delivering his monolog hed passed a test of some sort its going to be a real pleasure working with you donnie they shook hands and made an appointment for their next session when the door closed donnie buffett exhaled slowly and said a short silent prayer of thanks if weiser had turned inches to the right she wouldve seen the hypodermic syringe that a harried orderly had accidentally left on the bedside table just before the doctor entered the roomthe syringe that had been virtually the only thing in buffetts thoughts during the doctors entire visit he gripped the head of the bed with his large hands and tightened his ample biceps he moved up one inch sweat broke out another huge flex another inch he felt as if he were dragging the weight of ten men with him he reached for the syringe no not yet six inches to go he inhaled deeply and gripped the bed once more another inch then another he kept at it two more inches closer and closer a half inch he paused for a minute wiping the slick sweat from his eyes and feeling his heart slam fiercely from the immense effort donnie buffett figured this exertion was good it was perfect because when he injected the air into his vein the course of his racing blood would speed the bubble straight to his heart and jam it stopped like a swollen piston sending his whole body to join his legs in a sleep that was cold and deep and forever howdy john pellam stepped into the hospital room he startled the cop who dropped something on the floor hell buffett snapped you scared me sorry pellam walked past the flowers looking around dozens of bouquets wreaths plants pellam wondered if the nurses got irritated having to water all this foliage a pale pretty face appeared in the doorway pellam motioned her in this is nina donnie buffett she said hello how you doing came buffetts muffled voice he was contorted sideways bending down trying to pick up something from the floor struggling his face was red and slick with sweat you okay pellam walked around the bed buffett was reaching for a pen he had dropped no not a pen a syringe here ill get it pellam bent down retrieved the needle and stepped over to a plastic box that said used syringe disposal only no buffett shouted pellam paused and he and nina looked at the cop curiously ive got to give myself a shot you she asked dont the nurses do that buffett stared at the needle for several seconds he cleared his throat im you know a diabetic i can give them to myself pellam shrugged it was on the floor ill ask the nurse for a clean one he dropped it in the disposal box i dont mind buffetts eyes clung to the disposal box looking heartsick pellam reached for the nurse call button buffett barked ill do it myself later no trouble buffett snatched the button away from him i said id do it myself a difficult silence arose nina and pellam simultaneously asked him how he was feeling and he answered fine im fine more silence nina turned to the flowers examined them and refilled several of the vases with water buffett seemed angered by this but he said nothing and she didnt seem to notice that he was out of sorts pellam studied buffett for a moment and decided he looked pretty good all things considered apart from the red face and sweat he seemed to be a healthy man lying in bed the only evidence of injury he was dressed in a white blouselike gown speckled with small pale blue dots something you wanted buffett asked pellam did not know how to respond he wasnt expecting this constant level of hostility he said the first thing that came into his mind you need anything no im doing fine when the silence filled the room again buffett relented and made conversation i get kind of bored you know i got tv he motioned broadly at the old set as if they couldnt spot it themselves pellam said i guess i came by one of the reasons i was a little hotheaded the other day buffett was being forced to apologize and he didnt want to he watched a silent cnn news broadcast for a moment tankers unloading in some foreign port pellam was just starting to wonder if the cop would clam up and that would be that he was glancing at nina when buffett said i started it you were just you know reacting all this its got me kind of shook up i read in this magazine one time nina said glamour no mademoiselle think that if you have a serious accident its like youre a whole different person for at least six months afterwards she abruptly stopped speaking perhaps worried that buffett would think he was doomed to a half year of mental anguish but buffett was laughing well its got me a shitload of flowers you want any go right ahead nina shook her head oh i couldnt no buffett glanced at pellam and the mayor came by to visit me which isnt as exciting as say the mayor of la since our guy also has the buick dealership out on hes that kind of mayor you know there was a manic edge to buffetts voice maybe he was being cynical maybe he was really impressed that the mayor had come to visit him pellam couldnt tell buffett broke the silence that followed this by saying its just so damn boring tv sucks you know that i dont own one pellam said with more enthusiasm than he intended ive got a monitor but it doesnt receive its just hooked up to a vcr buffett sighed and began clicking the gray box of the remote control through a series of stations an old movie came on he shut the set off i should probably get some sleep im still in shock no really spinal shock its called not like ha normal shock sleepings a good thing the script in pellams mind now called for the cop to ask what he had come here to ask could buffett please call up his detective buddies and ask them to stop ruining his life but he coulndt ask pellam wondered what stopped him he believed it was not the fact that pellam was going to leave in a moment with a pretty woman beside him and go back to his job nor was it buffetts face which no longer looked so healthy as pellam had thought mouth hanging loose eyes darting filled with a fear that he perhaps thought he was concealing no what stopped pellam was simply that he stood and buffett lay as simple as that we better be going pellam said just wanted to stop by yeah buffett nodded good seeing you what do you read pellam asked ill bring you a magazine next time i stop by i dont read i dont like to read the mystery that pellam had brought on the first visit sat prominently unopened under the bedside table you got any hobbies yeah i got hobbies what buffett looked from the square of the tv screen to the box where pellam had pitched the hypodermic needle basketball softball jogging and hockey thosere my hobbies at the main desk of the hospital downstairs pellam remembered that he had met nina when she was visiting her mother he now asked if she wanted to see the woman she shook her head i visited her this morning twice a day is a little much she can be a dear but they stepped outside the day had grown overcast and chill she asked your parents both alive just my mother she lives in upstate new york i dont see her that often we run out of things to talk about after three days nina took a scarf from her pocket a long one covered with blotches of brilliant green and yellow she began to tie it around her neck he watched the flimsy cloth cover the pale skin at her throat she said im really enjoying that job you got me everybodys really nice making movies is fun at a certain level you get much higher up than location work or makeup and its a pain in the ass the only yucky part is special effects all that fake blood and those gunshot wounds she closed her eyes and shivered why does mr sloan make such violent movies because many many people pay money to watch them why she asked are you looking around so much am i yeah its like you think somebodys following you naw always working looking for locations in fact thats where were going right now find a big field need the help of a local im not a local remember im from cranston youre more local than i am is that the reason you want me to come along a faint smile on her frosted pink lips well scouting isnt as easy as it looks i sense youre a natural at it me i need a big field next to the river and a road running through it how would you go about finding one well i dont know i guess id just drive along a road beside the river until i found a field see what i mean youre a born location scout they both laughed all right but i have to be back at seven ive got a call then see i can talk movie call oh i didnt want to ask on the set but whats the difference between a gaffer and a grip the mostasked question in the movie business gaffers an electrician and lighting guy grips are workmen who do rigging and other nonelectrical work they approached her car another question pellam preempted her the best boy is the key grips first assistant no nina said tossing him the keys i was going to ask if you knew any casting couch stories peter crimmins was a member of the ukrainian social club in st louis he could easily have afforded to join the elite metropolitan club or although he was a barsinister christian the covington hills country club yet this was the only social organization he belonged to the club was in a shabby twostory building greasywindowed and grimy nestled between vacant lots filled with saplings strangled by kudzu the inside smelling of onions and cigarette smoke and mold was one large room filled with broken tables and chipped chairs the club seemed locked in a time warp dating to the year it had opened this afternoon crimmins was sitting at a table with joshua his driver and security chief they drank tea that had been brewed in a cheap samovar there were four or five other men in the club who would have liked to sit with crimmins but who tended not to when joshua was with him the bodyguards presence made them uncomfortable they of course knew all about crimmins they read the postdispatch as well as the ukranian daily news which reported respectively on his criminal activities and on his social ethnic and professional endeavors the latter did not interest them in the least any fool can give away money but a successful criminal is hot stuff so they sat around him basking in his dangerous presence crimmins gave them status john gotti had gone to his social club in little italy in new york peter crimmins went here they believed the nearby streets were safer because of him crimmins and joshua had been drinking tea for ten minutes when a broadshouldered man wearing a blue denim jacket and jeans entered his shirt was dirty he was squat though he moved with a certain elegance crimmins did not approve of the common clothes but this sort of man might be a foreman or carpenter in addition to being what crimmins was now hiring him for joshua said tom stettle mr crimmins how do you do sir stettles eyes swung one way then the other settling on crimmins s mole of an eye for a moment stettle is it yeah the voice said yessir sit down he did the samsonite folding chair creaked under his weight crimmins let the silence run up for a moment rather than feeling uncomfortable stettle grew more at ease and gazed back at crimmins pleasantly finally crimmins said joshua talked to you yessir this was not the safest way meeting stettle facetoface the identification issue later if it all went sour but crimmins liked to see the people who worked for him you could have a better conversation with someone when you knew what he looked like you could pick up on his mannerisms match them to his words that helped you decide if he was telling the truth if he was dependable how much he could be bought for youve been following him pellam stettle nodded the police have been too i know have you seen anyone else anyone from petersons office some off and on its funny its like hey we got the budget for it today but not tomorrow theyre not there more than theyre there crimmins had an urge to remind the man that he was making fifteen thousand dollars for this job but he said nothing another of his basic rules like providing for the family was dont jerk leashes until you need to stick with him this being the country pretty much its harder you know what im saying in the city with a lot of people around there are more ways to get away like cabs and subways you can set up things a lot faster the measured and respectful tone of stettles reply made crimmins feel comfortable he was pleased that stettle was giving a frank appraisal crimmins himself would have guessed it was easier to do this sort of thing in the country all right keep at it joshua knows where to get in touch with you both men nodded thanks for stopping by you want some tea some pastry no sir stettle left the club glancing around him with studious eyes crimmins supposed he was surveying the shoddy paneling job and thinking he could do better crimmins said to joshua is he good with it with what crimmins forgot that some people did not think as quickly as he did a gun thats not really the question alls i know is hes got one and he doesnt mind using it maddoxs got a mandatory sentencing thing and a lot of guys have a problem with that he doesnt crimmins rose and poured both joshua and himself two more glasses of tea eleven sil vous plait estce que vous avez un guest monsieur wetter the crackling of the eight thousand miles of cables and airwaves filled the phone non monsieur well estce quil a une reservation the crash behind pellam nearly made him drop the cellular phone he spun around he saw the fist knock on the camper door again pellam leaned forward and looked outside with a sinking heart them for some reason he could remember the names of the fbi agents more easily than he could those of the italian cop and the wasp cop bracken and monroe just a minute he called im on the phone more knocking just a minute im on the phone to paris repetez sil vous plait hes not okay i mean merci damn marty weller had left london six hours ago supposedly bound for paris he was not however at the plaza athenee where he always stayed or where he told everyone he stayedand pellam had no idea where he might be pellam was trying to make nice for the missed appointment with weller and telorian he dropped the phone in its cradle and opened the door he nodded solemnly but did not invite them in how you doing sir monroe said silence bracken looking much less scruffy today asked mr pellam you mind if we come in i think i would mind that yes it wont take very long pellam asked i really dont wed just like to ask you a few more questions our discussion discussion the other day wasnt very productive last night i told the cops in maddox exactly what happened for the second time maybe the third dont you people talk to each other monroe remained as pleasant and persistent as a doortodoor salesman we apologize for the other day weve been under incredible pressure you know how it is pellam waited a few seconds and said come in inside both agents sat on chairs scooting forward to keep their posture perfect the cuffs of their lightcolored slacks were hiked high above their ankles it was funny pellam thoughtthey didnt have the frisky presence of the city cops there was something anonymous about them they complimented him on the tidiness of the camper and bracken said enviously he hoped to get a winnebago himself one day drive up to minnesota for muskie and pike so far the game was good cop good cop the fact is maddox hasnt been cooperating with us they dont much care for federal officers wonder why wed really appreciate it if you could tell us whatever you can remember youve got to understand mr pellam mr gaudias death means that two years of work could be in jeopardy pellam wanted to reward them for being polite he told them the facts one more time in as much detail as he could remember the beer the lincoln the guy who bumped into him bending down and looking through the window the car pulling away the cop pellam was getting pretty good at telling the story by this time the agents were unemotional no eyes were rolled much less lapels grabbed and windows broken they just nodded and did not complain and they didnt call him a gfy either they just asked questions finally pellam realized that they had been here for an hour he was growing bored he felt like a hooked pike he almost mentioned this to bracken the fisherman tell us again just one more time promise just one okay once more pellam recited the story monroe wrote it down pellam wondered what they were getting paid and how much tax money was being spent to record an incident of car window glare then they began to ask questions that seemed to have nothing to do with the killing why was he going to get so much beer tell them about this poker game would he did he know who vincent gaudia was had he ever seen the policeman before no was it true that you gave something to the policeman just before the shooting well pellam said i did you seemed surprised just then why were you surprised when i gave him the bag no just now when we mentioned it well i didnt think anybody knew i gave him anything their eyebrows perked and what was it you think it was a bribe wed just like to know what it was it was a doughnut a doughnut whole wheat pellam offered it seemed healthier yessir more questions another half hour passed did the driver bracken asked have a cup caddy are you serious pellam asked he looked at his watch finally they stood up in unison as if his answer to their question did you know vince gaudia before he was killed no was the exit cue he walked them to the door they thanked him for his time then bracken turned to him and said you werent thinking of leaving town soon were you sir there was something in the tone he was not a bad cop yet but he was no longer a good cop either im staying until the films finished but how long will that be a week tops well you should knowwe have an intelligence report that peter crimminsthe main suspect in the gaudi killinghas been speaking to associates out of state chicago we think pellam didnt know what to make of this news bite that often happens bracken continued when a mob boss is going to hire some muscle they dont like to use anybody local oh i just say that so youll know to be careful right well i appreciate you telling me that as they walked out the door monroe thanked him again and added you know sir we have men at all the local airports all the airports amtrak too and they left him to wonder if that meant theyd be looking for hit men or that pellam himself should book a seat on greyhound if he wanted to escape the long tentacle of the law the nurse noticed his bloody thumbnail what she asked whatsat she was filipino short and broad she had kind eyes but the wispy mustache and broad purple lips made her face look dirty which in turn gave her an impression of cruelty or at best indifference the nurse pulled two clear plastic gloves off a roll she put them on and lifted his hand studying the red stain distastefully i dont have aids he said miserably she held his hand in a solid grip and twisted it as she examined the digit god she was strong he detected a meaty smell coming from her where you do it what do you mean where you stick yourself abruptly she yanked the sheet and blanket off of him and began with his midthigh probing her way up turning him pushing his numb legs buffett thought of dough bread dough kneading it this made him want to cry im all right could you just leave me alone please you make it worse you people make it worse fingers he could not feel were searching along his skin he closed his eyes he made it a test even now in his humiliation and anguish he tried to sense the fingers he thought he could tell where she was probing but when he opened his eyes her hands were not near where he had imagined her touch he couldnt feel a thing then she saw the tissue stuffed in his boxer shorts she lifted it out the wadded kleenex blotched with dark blood buffetts face burned sweat broke out on his face the nurses cruel or indifferent mouth tightened she dropped the kleenex into the wastebasket and bent and spread apart his pubic hair she studied the small gash next to his penis it wasnt long or deep but it had bled a lot the hair was matted and there was a red stain on the catheter the nurse sighed then took short shiny scissors and trimmed the thick hair back she washed the cut and put gauze over it then taped the gauze to the spot with white adhesive tape she pulled the gloves off and threw them out im sorry he said i just her dark lids lowered knowingly you wanted to see if you could feel something her tongue clicked people like you you make it worse you make everybodys job worse buffett watched her go his eyes then slipped to the medical waste box where his precious syringe had been he looked up at the blank tv screen hands in his lifeless lap and stared at the ceiling waiting for tears that never came finally he reached up and in fury began tugging at a jump rope which was hung over a traction bar above his bed after he had spent the entire morning am to noonhaving tests done buffett had asked an orderly to rig a rope over the bar so he could work on his arms he would grip the handles hard pulling against himself first letting the right arm be the weak one then the left the orderly watched him with approval man i aint gonna armwrestle you buffett now began the workout again he was counting down from sixty when he exercised he always counted down rather than up because it was harder to quit if your goal was to reach zero fiftyeight fiftyseven fiftysix if you did quit before you got to your goal that was the worst something terrible would happen like for instance the terror would get you fortyseven fortysix fortyfive sweating pull pull pull on diirtythree wendy weiser strolled into the room hey donnie yo doctor how you feeling today nifty buffett kept a nifty smile on his face phantom pain phantom smile fair enough huh she pulled up the chair in that way of hers and dropped into it like she was sitting on her boyfriends lap he thought of it as charming he was not quite sure if that word fit or how someone can sit charmingly but thats what he thought he had been here two or three days now and hed had five dreams about her already sometimes when he was awake he fantasized about her he thought about the way she sat down the way she kept her legs spread slightly when she sat the way she slouched which hid the shape of her breasts the way her panty hose would rustle the lab coat would fall he did not let the fantasies get beyond that point dr weiser was the only thing that troubled him about killing himself he hoped she wouldnt be the one to find his body you want something to drink scotch glenfiddich aged twelve years neat snappy dannie snappy jokes oj ill pass she opened his chart i see weve got you lined up for more tests over the next couple days there still isnt much to report spinal shock is slowly subsiding weiser then did some poking and probing of her own and went through the same neuro exams that gould had done a few days before when he touched his nose she said good the same way gould had and though he wished her version meant something more than his it clearly didnt she made a notation on his chart sat back then lit a cigarette you cut yourself she said he nodded avoiding her eyes he pushed a dangling handle of the jump rope out of the way i his words stopped i know how anxious you are to find out about your recovery she said kindly but until the shock subsides all you can do is hurt yourself doing something like that you could get a bad infection hospitals are filthy theyre full of bacteria sepsis donnie whispered desperately sepsis she studied him for a moment then said you want to know about sex i want to he nodded then confessed i wanted to see if i could feel anything down there she told him it was too early to know much but she agreed to tell him a few things weiser added i dont have much time now im going away for a couple days his heart choked she was leaving him the terror at least was pleased at this news and pawed buffett mercilessly as he sweated and clung to the gingham jump rope where you going he asked to take his mind off the terrors maul i have place at lake of the ozarks you married im divorced he remembered she had mentioned that weiser added i have a boyfriend i go down there some horses a lot of horses i remember and trees a vague memory came to him then vanished unfortunately donnie there are no short answers to the sexual aspects of sci aspect you doctors use funny words for an instant his facade cracked she paused as she noticed the blip of anger in his face his smile returned you worry about it a lot what the hell else is there to do he grinned i stare at vanna whites tits all day long weiser laughed we know from the location and nature of the trauma that you wont be able to walk again donnie at least not with the state of the technology now but sexual dysfunction is still an open question in this stage of your recovery dis function dis function buffett was hugely disappointed in her she was bullshiting him partnership a good team crap even in the worst case theres a lot we can do as she talked his thoughts wandered down at her summer place how often would she fuck her boyfriend would she tell him about buffett would she lie underneath him and whisper to him that she had spent the morning talking about pricks and come to a eunuch would that make her boyfriend hump her harder two concerns the act of intercourse and second siring children now a man she probably made love to her boyfriend four five times a week she probably had shuddering orgasms she probably took him into her mouth two types of erections reflexogenic and psychogenic reflexogenic are caused by some stimuli to the genitals the penis of course primarily but also to the prostate or bladder you dont need your brain to participate in order to have this kind of erection ping sweat sprang to buffett s skin the terror was having a ball buffetts armpits itched he felt sweat appearing where it never had beforehis cheek his ears the backs of his hands jesus god almighty his wrists were sweating as if the moisture were crawling out of his flawed body escaping you wake up in the morning with an erection thats reflexogenic psychogenic is the type of erection in response to fantasies visual stimulithoughts that turn us on weiser paused to ask are you okay hot in here she stood up and opened the window she turned her back to him and the silk skirt was taut against her butt he saw the outline of her panties donnie swallowed she sat down again lit a cigarette drew on it deeply three times then crushed it out ill give you an exam well find out if your lesion is uppermotor neuron or lowermotor neuron if its upper youll be able to have reflexogenic erections what is she talking about if its lowermotor neuron that will mean your sexual activity will be what we call areflexic psychogenic buffett tried to concentrate he hated words like that big words doctor words the terror ate them up they gave the terror strengthha a hardon it stirred and stepped over his pain the phantom pain the betraying pain and slid into his gut then the terror moved through his chest buffett clenched his teeth and tightened his stomach muscles to keep it from oozing into his heart where he knew it would kill him he kept his eyes locked on to hers and he pulled at the jump rope hard arm wrestling with the terror there are four possibilities you could be complete or incomplete reflex or complete or incomplete areflex the most severe is complete areflexthat means no reflex activity and no brain involvement here is donnie buffett six feet away from a beautiful woman with sparkling green eyes talking to him about hard dicks he glances down at the small motionless bump at his groin and feels the terror dig an inch closer to his heart usually in the case of gunshots the lesion isnt complete in the case of areflexic patients with incomplete lesions threefourths of them have intercourse and more than half have ejaculations and orgasms but im not going to be one of them a girl in a tight leather skirt talks to me about coming and i cant feel a thing it may not be necessaryit probably wont bebut you might want to consider a prosthetic buffett thought that meant artificial leg there are a couple different kinds of penile implants the terror was really up for this carousing squirming swimming on its fucking back the sweat poured buffett swallowed now on the question of siring children spinal injury generally results in a decreased sperm count but many people without sci have problems conceiving and there are a number of techniques a son what about a son and that was itbang the terror got him donnie buffett shook like an antelope in a lions jaws her eyes were narrowing a little squinting as he wiped the sweat off his face donnie he looked at her and swallowed im sorry he tapped his shoulder ive still got a hell of a lot of pain you know where i got shot here its really a bitch sometimes do you want something for it no i just get these twinges makes me sweat like a pig keep going a smile please he could say that only because he was dead the terrors fangs had shredded his heart he was gone he was as polite as a corpse at the wake she continued for a few minutes then offered some conclusion something cheerful something snappy he nodded and had no idea what she had said she said she was sorry she had to leave theyd talk again soon he thanked her looked her right in the eye and said thiss been real you know reassuring i appreciate it they shook hands buffett told her to have a nice weekend when she was gone he picked up the phone and called bob gianno at the maddox police station they talked about nothing for a while and when buffett could wait no longer he asked the detective for a phone number there was silence for a moment and then buffett heard the numbers he memorized them he asked gianno this is one of those cellular phones right yeah its in his winnebago and i just call it like a regular number thats all you have to do twelve through his closed eyes donnie buffett was aware of a shadow over him he hoped it was not penny he particularly hoped it wasnt her parents the nurse changing the urine bag would have been okay the nurse changing the foleys wouldnt have been he was pleased to see that it was john pellam buffett said hey chief its you pellam nodded and walked into the room you got more flowers looks like a nursery yeah i dont like flowers so much you know she said she didnt want them that girl of yours but you ought to take some to her whats her name tell her you bought em im glad you called i was going to stop by buffett waved to the chair why you in the mood for more abuse pellam laughed i was feeling bad you know i was a real shit no problem pellam said i kind of go crazy i didnt i understand you doing okay buffett nodded and laughed im fine i was i think the doctor called it resisting i was resisting what happened to me if you go with it you feel better good a little therapy ill get a wheelchair therere a lot of laws wheelchair access go to the cardinals games they gotta have ramps you can get practically anywhere i saw they have sports for you know pellam was hesitating maybe not sure whether to say paraplegics or handicapped what he said was wheelchair sports i saw it on the espn yeah basketball wheelchair basketball and some guys do the marathon i guess you can coast downhill man he said smiling thats medoing a marathon sitting on my ass hey you want something to eat thanks a ton hospital food naw i got some good stuff here ruffles dip cookies pellam shook his head buffett ate half a cookie and stared into the cellophane bag for a moment he rolled the top of the bag tight set it on a tray pellam did a tour of the greenhouse by the window he said so how long you been on the force close to seven years you say that force sure you can say that and you walked a beat like in the old days some neighborhoods arent so good anymore maddoxs really gone to the dogs so you make movies not me i just find locations howd you get into that fell into it i guess i like to travel you meet any hollywood honeys you must huh i stay clear of the coast not my scene really then whyre you in movies whyre you a cop buffett shrugged oh i forgot pellam lifted the stained bag he carried its beer can you drink it hell yes i can drink it pellam sat down on the sturdy gray chair they opened two cans and drank them down you know buffett said all these guys i work with mean sons of bitches some of them its like they turn into pussies when they come to see me they bring me flowers they bring me magazines nobodys brought me any beer a lot of guys dont come i think theyre nervous or something about seeing me about what theyre going to say pellam stood up and slipped two fresh cans in the water pitcher next to the bed he filled it with cold water the lid did not close completely if you got a spacey nurse maybe you can get away with it predate it chief pellam sipped his beer he waited a moment then said i guess i wanted to say this last time but well you looked pretty upset and i held off say what im really getting hassled your buddiesand the fbi nowtheyre really on my case theyve been on the set and its messing up the film im worried about my job i cant afford that right now buffett shrugged if you didnt see anything you didnt see anything yeah but they dont feel that way and theyre all over the place the fbis talking about looking into the companys tax returns and corporate documents pellam made a helpless gesture with his hands oh the fedsre pricks from the gitgo buffett said as if explaining something as basic as gravity then he nodded ron petersonhes the us attorneyhes a maniac he explained about gaudia and crimmins and the minutes program petersons going to get crimmins and nothing in this world is going to stop him pellam continued i want to help i dont want to be a gfy but this brought a spark to buffetts eyes he started to laugh whats so funny pellam was irritated somebody called you a gfy your friends the detectives gianno and hagedorn buffett laughed again nobody told you what that means they told me it meant a reluctant witness pellam believe half of what cops tell you it means go fuck yourself very funny very goddamn funny buffett continued to laugh after a moment pellams mouth curled upward and he laughed loud gfy thats good i gotta admit listen pellam i got a deal for you i want you to do me a favor you do it and ill tell the department to lay off i cant do anything with the bureau but theyll listen to me at maddox police youd do that you got my word whats this favor no big deal theres something in my house i want you to get for me me if you wouldnt mind no i guess not buffett saw pellams eyes flick to buffetts wedding ring he asked why not have your wife bring it when she comes to visit the thing is buffert said as his determined and cheerful eyes moved from pellams face to the fuzzy tv screen itd upset her it was a small neighborhood of bungalows set on postagestampsize lawns five minutes from downtown maddox both the dark brick houses and the grass were well tended and trim pleasant pellam believed he had cruised along this street on his quest for the perfect tony sloan bungalow the traffic from a nearby expressway was an irritating sticky rush that filled the air and yellow haze from a half dozen brick smokestacks hung thick over the yards pellam climbed off the yamaha he paused in front of the house and checked the address there was a white nissan in the driveway and behind it a brown mercury station wagon with illinois plates the small garden in front held the corpses of flowering plants stalks mostly bleak pellam knew nothing about gardening but if this had been his lawn he would have added some evergreens he walked up the winding brick path to the small porch one other thing he noticed there were no tricycles or other toys here as there were in all of the other yards he pressed the bell there was no answer he opened the screen door and banged a large brass knocker a moment later the door opened he was looking at a thin brunette with a long face cautious and nondescript late twenties she had flawless skin every time he glanced away from her he forgot what she looked like mrs buffett yes she held the door as far open as the thick brass chain would allow a sickening sweet scent maybe air freshener maybe cheap perfumeflooded out im john pellam a blink then understanding right right right donnie said you were coming by a formal smile she didnt offer her first name buffett had told him it was penny i have to pick up a few things thats what he said the door closed then opened the chain unhooked she motioned him inside he saw two other people her parents he guessed the woman was what penny would be in twenty years thin whitehaired with beautiful skin and very cautious pennys father was in his late fifties with a businessmans paunch under his pink shortsleeved shirt they both stared at pellam he introduced himself stan brickell the man said im pennys father thiss my wife ruth the woman nodded it occurred to him that if he said im sorry by way of general sympathy they might think buffett had died he asked you live in the area carbondale pellam nodded i just saw him an hour ago donnie he looked pretty good you on the force with him im a friend penny said donnies mentioned you a couple times he had what do you have to pick up some forms for the office penny said i could take them i have to stop by the criminal court building its pretty grim down there donnie said this was the lie that buffett had coached him on i would though if he wanted me to take them there i would she said this with great sincerity it was then that pellam noticed the burning candle it was a funny thing red thick about three feet high with charms stuck onto it it had been burning for a long time there was a slick puddle of wax in the black saucer the candle rested on two burning sticks of incense angled out of the shaft thats what was stinking up the house sandalwood or something it reminded him of high schoolblack lights the jefferson airplane peace symbols that meant peace and tiedye that was fashionable not nostalgic he looked around the living room the candle was a hint but it did not prepare him for the collection of paintings statues and icons all religious mostly crudely done pellam wondered if penny had made them herself there were pictures of native africans thin black men and women with intense euphoric gazes there were wooden crosses spattered with dark red paint posters of pentagrams and star charts and crystals a large glass pyramid inside of which was a shriveledup brown and fleshcolored object it looked like a dried apricot like many of these objets dart the pyramid was covered with dust would you like some coffee ruth asked oh sure coffee from penny no thanks ruth said no trouble no really i cant stay long if you could just show me donnies office penny pointed the way the office was really a bedroom slowly becoming a den it was small on the walls were sheets of thin paneling of light stained wormwoodwith tiny black holes like miniature cigarette burns donnie had probably done the work himself half of the sheets still showed the nailheads a sixfoot piece of unstained crown molding had been mounted where the panel joined the ceiling a half dozen other pieces of molding sat in the corner it was going to be a long time before the work got finished pellam thought with sadness he opened the bottom drawer of buffetts desk he moved aside the box donnie had told him about and found what he was looking for he slipped the thick envelope into his pocket as he stood he heard a womans voice eerily droning ommmm pellam returned to the living room where sat three people whose only bond seemed to be this tragedy penny was in front of the candle her voice solid and strong like a car in low gear nothing was going to stop it tears were in her eyes she sat japanese style on her haunches she hummed faster and faster ommmm ruth was sitting back on the couch tracing the yellow herringbone pattern of the upholstery with a short unpolished nail stan said to her bluntly get me some coffee and a sandwich watch the mayonnaise you gave me too much last time pennys eyes were closed and from her lips came the melancholy drone of her prayer pellam said goodbye to no one he opened the door and let himself out he was going to wait until he got to the yamaha to take the envelope out of his pocket but he stopped on the walk and lifted it out he saw what was irritating his leg the hammer of the smith wesson pistol had worn through the paper pellam covered it with maddox police department aided report forms and walked to the motorcycle a fleck of dust pedaled through the air of gennaros bakery philip lombros eyes followed it for a long moment then turned backto ralph bales youre not eating your cannoli its good i like it ralph bales said for a stocky man a man who loved steak and pasta and hamburgers he had a curious dislike for desserts he wondered why it was he was always ended up sitting in restaurants eating sweets and drinking coffee and tea on deals like this im a slow eater my wife youre married lombro asked surprised was married shed be finished with her veal and id still have most of it left its healthier to eat slower you should chew your food each bite i mean fifty times i dont do that but youre supposed to the bakery was not very authentic ralph bales noted not like the ones he grew up near it was for one thing very clean and the girls wore yellow and brown waitress uniforms and the miniature pastries in the spotless glass cases were like the rings and necklaces in the famous barr jewelry department he didnt like it a bakery should be dark and full of wood and the pastries should be behind dirty cracked glass the room should be filled with the smell of yeast and they shouldnt charge three seventyfive for a damn piece of cannoli lombro was nodding with little interest my brothers wife makes these theyre better than this one i think they fill these ahead of time here youre not supposed to do that you were telling me you found the man who was the witness yes whats his name ralph bales had anticipated this question peter james there were twentyseven people named peter pete or p james in the st louis phone book also it was a name that someone might mix up was that james peters jim peters lombro examined his napkin and replaced it on his lap and youve talked to him okay we had a long talk ralph bales said in a low voice he recited his next line he was pretty damn scared when he saw me coming but hes agreed to play ball with us play ball that means that means he wants some money and he wont identify me thats what it means yeah lombro sipped his coffee sitting back ankle on knee looking like a mafia don do you trust him well lombro said i mean if he takes the money will he keep his word ralph bales thought for a minute and said youre never sure about these things he had not rehearsed this but he liked the lines but i got good vibes from him hes not a pro hes scared and i think hell keep his word what does he do this was a question that ralph bales had not anticipated he spent a long time shrugging and sipping coffee works some kind of job in st louis i dont know computers or something and what exactly has he got to sell he described you to the letter he said he looked through the window and got a complete description lombro touched the silvery hair at his temple as if this news gave him a headache why didnt he tell the police another foreseen question he was scared like i said did you threaten him ralph bales poked at his pastry did you lombro repeated sternly okay i made it clear that we werent happy i told him we were willing to go to extremes if we had to i was trying to you know negotiate it down but i told youi didnt hurt him did it work whats that negotiating not much no how much does he want ralph bales stopped poking and took a bite of pastry fifty thousand uhm ralph bales counted to twelve as his script called for then he said earnestly i know you dont want my opinion but theres a way id rather handle it this was to make the fifty thousand more appealing no more killing i forbid it forbid it ralph bales tried to remember the last time he had heard someone use that word not his father maybe a priest at school forbid it was a word that belonged in an oldtime movie im just telling you your options thats not an option with one square of paper napkin philip lombro wiped the flecks of pastry from his lips and when he was through doing so he took another square and wiped the heel of his shoe then he asked another question one that ralph bales had not anticipated though it was one of those questions that did not really need an answer i suppose he wants us to pay him in small bills doesnt he hey donnie buffett opened his eyes john pellam stood looking at him buffett inhaled slowly hi chief you okay pellams eyes flickered with concern yeah i was theres this exercise its supposed to calm you down it doesnt work too good well some beerll calm you down you want another beer yeah i want another beer in addition to a damp paper bag pellam was holding a thick white envelope buffett looked at it first and the bag second pellam closed the door buffett said they got a rule against that yeah whatre you a cop he opened two pint fosters buffet looked at the blue and red logo oh yes that stuff really gives me a buzz is that a kangaroo on there its not going to hurt you is it i mean like with medicine youre taking buffett drank down three good swallows oooo he said slowly jubilation pellam sat down in the chair he held the envelope in one hand buffett stared at it donnie uh your wife she say anything about that he nodded toward the envelope she didnt see it buffett drank more of the ale he wasnt looking at pellam she was kind of chanting when i left the cop studied his beer yeah she does that some its like a you know hobby we get a lot of that out in california shes real sweet good kid and a cook you want to talk pasta pennys the best she cooks all kinds she makes white clam sauce you know anybody else whos ever made white clam sauce i met stan

chanting she had this candle burning buffett laughedthough he guessed his eyes did not join in he said shes kind of superstitious like with reagan remember nancy had an astrologer a lot of people are into that kind of stuff now crystals he reached over to the table and lifted up a clear green stone greens supposed to make you well again penny got it for me his voice caught and he swallowed im supposed to wear it but i figured my blue cross goes out the window if they find out im getting treated by spirit guides he laughed again the sound turned into a shallow cough im supposed to keep turning otherwise all this shit settles in my lungs his face went dark and still im working out too he nodded to the jump rope ill be back in shape in no time wheelchair basketball ill whup your ass i dont even play basketball pellam said buffett was looking at the envelope you found it okay pellam handed it to him its pretty beatup thats what maddox issues you buffett shook the gun out of the envelope and held it lovingly he clicked it open and looked at the shells inside he read the engraved circular word remington five times he did not seem to hear pellams question but a moment later he said its a cold gun whats that pellam asked a gun with the registration filed off untraceable sometimes you go into a drug bust therere a lot of cold guns around so you pick up one and keep it like for a backup buffett spun the cylinder then said well i use them for backup lotta cops use them for something else like for when theres some asshole coming at you in an alley and you tell him to stop but he doesnt buffett stopped speaking as if this were explanation enough pellam shook his head buffett whispered you see what im saying you take him out with your service piece then slip a cold gun in his hand when they have the shooting hearing you tell them you had to shoot him because he had a piece he found he was sweating and wiped his face that happens a lot some they know it goes on the thing is if you die with something in your hand the muscles tighten up on it right away so its a hassle to get the guys prints on it the shooting board always suspects but unless it happens to the samfe cop a lot theyd rather come down on our side he looked up thanks for doing this you really think theres a chance the killerll come back try to hit you here i just feel a whole lot better with a piece he nodded at the gun i hear you pellam finished his fosters shouldve brought some peanuts buffett set his ale down stomach mustve shrunk used to be a time when i could drink three of these youll still be able to buffett s eyes flashed dont do that i hate it what making it sound like everythings gonna be fine everythings going to be hunkydory thats what my mother used to say hunkydory and peachy pellam shrugged youre the one bitching and moaning about your capacity to chug im just telling you its well dont tell me okay sure you want yeah i want there was a long moment of silence buffett said finally look pellam im sorry youre too easygoing you ought to tell me to fuck off you ought to slug me i never hit a man with a gun im tired i think i need some sleep ill make some calls like i said tell the guys to lay off you thanks i gotta go anyway i got a date date that local girl you met the blonde pretty damn clever pellam you promise em parts in the film and then wham bang they get a part they werent expecting you hollywood guys not quite this one hates movies hates movies whats her name again nancy nina one goodlooking woman shes here pellam said nodding toward the corridor her mother had an operation or something he looked at the smith wesson ive got a smittie at home i do some shooting sometimes buffett nodded but he was distracted he kept looking at the gun imagining what it would feel like when the bullet entered his brain how long would he continue to think what would he see he thought fuck you terror buffett looked up sorry pellam had been talking about his famous ancestor and he now repeated the story buffets eyes showed momentary amusement wild bill hickok bullshit well thats the story even if its not true it got me interested in american history and started me collecting old guns whatd he shoot a wild bill nope gun of choice was an navy colt thirtysix caliber whats that three fiftyseven pellam nodded toward the smith wesson in buffetts hand this no standard thirtyeight special could i heft it for a minute buffett handed it to him butt first and as pellam studied it the cop said pellam one thing when you saw my wife did you tell her anything about me i dont remember i guess i told her you seemed to be doing okay did you thanks pellam put the gun in his pocket buffett looked at the outline of the pistol what are you doing pellam said i think ill hold on to it for a while naw naw give it here buffett thought pellam was joking i dont think so whatre you nuts give it here pellam said i was thinking about it you know and it just doesnt make a lot of sense theres a twentyfourhour cop up the hall hospital security guards at the front door i dont think the killerd be stupid enough to try to come back well who the hell are you to risk my life i think im saving your life donnie another blink pellam said what were you really going to do with the gun give it here what were you going to do with it give me my fucking gun buffett shouted then he spat out viciously i could slash my wrists i could take an overdose well do it im just not going to help you its my gun buffett cried please tears began he wiped them away angrily his arms slumped and his hands fell to his lap its gotta be tough pellam said but you dont want to do that he touched his pocket you dont understand buffett whispered im never going to walk im never going to fuck a woman again in my life never ill never have any kids you dont understand the way you feel now isnt the way i feel buffett shouted how do you know what i feel how could you possibly know pellam exhaled slowly after a moment of enduring the hopelessness in the cops face he said ill be in town for another week you still want the gun when i leave ill give it to you then yeah whats going to be different in a week buffett snarled ill still be lying on my ass with bedsores ill still be pissing into a rubber ill have a wife talking to the stars and friends whore embarrassed to come see me one week give it to me pellam opened the door and stepped out one week thirteen this was not a place he would have chosen to be buried in philip lombro would have preferred more variety trees hills large rocks rising out of the ground like stonehenge but he decided this was a foolish thought how could you have a cemetery with tree roots uneven ground stone cemeteries were like any other real estate death had to be financially practical the cemetery outside of maddox resembled the acreage around a prefab midwestern grade school beyond he could see a development of pastel houses all similarly styled in each yard were two small maples crowned with colored leaves webby like the sponge of hogauge trees in the scenery sets he bought for his nephews lombro parked on the side of the cinder drive and got out of the lincoln he walked slowly through the trim grass several of the graves were caved in at the corners he felt queasy as he looked down into these tiny dark pits and he wondered if with a flashlight one could see the coffins themselves this terrified him he hated this place and he was angry at his brother for buying plots here instead of mount pleasant where their parents were buried the day was milkysunny and hot indian summer he supposed though he never knew exactly what that meant could it be a metaphor for the indians attempting a final assault after they had been conquered by the settlers but that seemed too lofty and dark for such an innocent phrase his feet bristled through lawn stubbly with crabgrass and he noticed his shoes were dusty from disintegrating yellow leaves he bent down and stroked the grass it was unpleasantly tough the stem of a dandelion was the only softness his fingers touched he stood and continued toward the gravesite lombro wore a dark suit and he was sweating he would not take off his jacket the dead he believed deserve all our respect the cemetery was not crowded the hour was early on a weekday and only dedicated mourners were present two elderly women locked arm in arm stood nearby over an old grave which was not marked by a monument but by a small dark metal plate lombro remembered that every veteran was entitled to a marker like this and he wondered if the women were standing above a father who died in verdun a husband at normandy or a son at da nang when he arrived at the grave he did not have the reaction he believed he would experience he did not cry he felt numb hardly touched at all the way a shy man freezes in front of a very beautiful woman he looked down at the turnedover earth he knew they used bulldozers to dump the dirt into the graves and he was glad he did not see any tread marks on the clayish earth the gravestone was gray marble and polished so smooth it reflected the dark wilted flowers a breeze disturbed the green tissue enfolding the flowers that he held he had forgotten they were in his hand he set them on the dirt then decided the paper would shred in the rain and look bad he pulled it off and stuffed it into his pocket he turned and walked back to his car as he did it occurred to him that all his life he had been a man who was not afraid to act being this way had made him very wealthy a linchpin in his family respected andin certain circlesheld in awe and fear yet now he believed that what he had donekilling vincent gaudiahad altered him altered him fundamentally not because it was violent but because it was an act beyond his world of experience he had put in motion people and forces that were behaving in ways he could not control in ways he could not even predict the gun that had fallen in the tile bathroom of orsinisralph bales s gunand had put the two men together had been the first link in a long horrible chain reaction of those forces which had the effect of making him feel small and powerless lombro leaned against his car the wind was gentle and filled with crackling dry heat lombro saw ralph bales driving up the road now his squat head through the gray glass of the car lombro reached into his pocket and pulled out the yellow envelope that contained fifty thousand dollars he wanted the meeting to be over with as soon as possible he wished there were no witness he wished he had never met ralph bales but most of all philip lombro wished that the dead all around him lying in their still beds of level rootand rockfree earth would all at once rise and begin to laugh and talk as if they were not dead at all but had merely been lulled into a light sleep by the glorious peace of an unseasonably warm afternoon after hours of cruising up and down the riverbanks of the wide missouri and the big muddy pellam at last found the field that would be the site of ross and dehlias catastrophic last heist driving and stopping then driving on he had been close to giving up hope state parks private yards railroad easements pastoral grass rolling toward the water boggy grassland long stretches of revetments of crushed gray and black rock nothing that would work for the film sitting on the campers dashboard was a note from the key grip pleading for a location within twentyfour hours and sitting in the seat beside him was the reclining figure of nina sassower pellam forcing himself to ignore both had turned a bend driven through a stand of dense oak and maple and braked the camper to a squealing halt i think this is it the field was a lush five acres defined by dense rows of trees just starting to colorsome leaves would have to be spraypainted or draped with green netting the film was set in june a church facade would have to be constructed sloans wish to have the shootout involve schoolchildren had given way to his slightly more tasteful burst of inspiration the innocent victims would be churchgoers but those were the only necessary modifications the grass was high an asphalt road stretched timidly between the field and the riverbank which was a tenfoothigh stone incline that dipped into the soupy water of the missouri river he stepped outside and took two dozen polaroids then returned to the cab he started the campers engine and sped back toward town why nina asked with curiosity is that field any different than the other ones because theres less junk uhm he began and decided he couldnt explain i mean it is a nice field and all she said quickly perhaps taking his silence as disappointment at her reaction pellam noticed that ninas interest in film had grown considerably perhaps this was due to her employment she was by all reports an excellent makeup artist perhaps it was also due to her reading pellam s copy of the final revised shooting script for missouri river blues it looked like a students endofterm notebook stuffed with smudged limp sheets all different colors indicating the various drafts of dannys rewrites it required diligent shuffling to proceed from start to finish but the script had held her interest all afternoon and more than that had even brought her to tears driving in silence heading back to maddox pellam glanced at her again noting her damp eyes she closed the script im sorry its so sad john pellam had not cried for a long time and he could not remember the last time he had cried watching a movie nina looked ahead unseeing at the road i lost a relative not too long ago pellam muttered condolences who was it he asked lost in thought she had not heard his question and he repeated it an aunt she was elderly but a car accident her voice faded dannys new ending was a slowmotion angle of rosss packard tumbling into the river after she died i had this urge no not an urge this need to put what i felt into words people tended to share things with pellam and to confess secrets to him it happened everywhere he went it happened at the unlikeliest of times he supposed this was because he was always just passing through they could unburden themselves and then he would vanish their confidences safe i looked through some of my books and i found a poem do not go gentle into that good night its funny about poetry back then isnt it i mean it was all stiff and formal but i could understand it its a nice poem pellam knew the poet was dylan thomas he couldnt remember a word of the poem pellam let the traffic lights guide him he was lost but he figured that the stoplights would be denser closer to downtown maddox where he could get his bearings he steered toward the red and green and yellow did you read it at her funeral yes i was surprised it went well real well i thought id cry and spoil it but i didnt have you ever done that read something at a funeral pellam thought back to the most recent memorial service he might have been a featured speaker at it had been seven years ago in santa monica the deceased had been his closest friend the actor tommy bernstein pellam had not attended the service she didnt say anything more and they drove in silence for ten minutes then cruised into downtown maddox he parked with the engine still running near tony sloans trailer sloan would be at the threemonitor kem editing machine now reviewing work prints he would not tolerate being disturbed pellam left the polaroids and a brief location report with sloans poor jittery ponytailed assistant director and returned to the camper they drove along main street and parked beside a small grocery store wishing to change the relentlessly somber mood he said suddenly watermelon lets get some watermelon in october sometimes you just get this craving come on inside a small grocery store he bought a plastic container of chunks of watermelon its not real red she said pellam asked the salesgirl where do you get watermelon in october oh from up north pellam said to nina its eskimo watermelon farmers market the girl said pointing in a direction he assumed must be north pellam asked for two forks and napkins outside they walked up the street spitting seeds into their hands and sticking them into the dirt in the big concrete planters along the street next year nina said well have to come back and harvest the crop pellam didnt really think about nina in terms of next year a dark car cruised past slowly and pellam had the vague impression of eyes staring at him the fork stopped halfway to his mouth and he watched the car as it sped up and continued on they wandered out of downtown nina stopped and stared in the window of a store that sold shoes encrusted with costume jewelry stones glitter fake gold why on earth would anyone in maddox buy a pair of shoes like this wicked witch of the north he said nina said it was the west maybe she does like movies after all oh pellam said i only like the tornado scene when i was a little girl i used to think it was wicker witch we had a wicker patio set i wouldnt sit in it i thought it i dont know was made out of witches pellam smiled she took his arm and brushed her cheek against his shoulder i finally outgrew it i still dont like wicker though you get splinters in your butt he said you look good when you smile which seemed to be just the words to deflate it but she brought a facsimile back to her mouth and said thank you that was when they found the factory pellam noticed a redbrick building set back a long ways from the road the grounds were filled with overgrown trees brush and rampant kudzu so thick you could only see the top of the tall square building it had high gracefully arched windows decorated with iron grillwork the setting sun was visible through them and lit the interior with broad shafts of ruddy illumination pellam started up the path nina followed the maddox machinery and die company had been abandoned for years the building had an odd regalness about it something castlelike complete with parapets and a dip in the surrounding ground that was probably a collapsed septic system but could pass for a moat the bottom six or seven feet of the outer walls were marked with halfhearted graffiti and the metal door was thickly posted with several generations of no trespassing signs metal art deco designs in the shape of lilies and vines and the companys name were set in concrete around the door nina walked up silently behind him she looked up at the facade what a neat old building pellam tried the front door the lock was long broken though the double wooden panels were chained he pushed inward as far as he could separating them by two feet then he worked his way inside underneath the chain do you think you should nina asked as his boot vanished into the doorway she timidly followed inside pellam paused on the oak floor worn wavy by years of workers boots and hand trucks to the right were the darkened factory offices banisters and windows were done in streamlined aluminum and in faded murals muscular laborers towered high above them to the left through an arched doorway was a huge cavernous space now lit red by the intense sun glowing on the yellowed greasy windows the ceiling was nearly forty feet high nina walked up behind pellam this is too good to pass up he said i thought the field was all you needed thisd be for another film ive got in mind ill get the polaroid be right back after pellam ducked out of the chained door nina walked to the back wall where she had seen in the shadows what she believed was an antique calendar and some other artifacts that might be worth swiping before the movie crews descended it was not a calendar though just a poster of the bee gees which would have been dated circa she guessed some lads had used the building as a clubhouse years ago she found an old empty tin of cat food a dozen beer bottles burnt matches nina walked into a large windowless office in which rested a piece of sleek green machinery like a huge sewing machine she squinted into the darkness and poked around in drawers and cabinets for ten minutes she found a beautiful antique orange crate but it was too big to get through the chained door clouds suddenly obsdured the sun leaving nina in gray shadow she felt a chill and with it a sense of uneasiness she started walking quickly back to the front of the factory she stopped in the dust on the floor in front of her nina could see her own footsteps leading back to the poster and the machine room and there were pellams sharptoed boot prints retreating through the arched front doorway she saw another set of prints too they disappeared into the back of the building through the offices they had been made very recently nina gasped in fear and looked at the arched doorway beyond which was the chained front door one hundred feet away and fifty or sixty of those feet led past darkened doorways john she called there was no answer the panic zipped along her spine and seized the back of her neck tears popped into her eyes step by step slowly to keep the fear at bay she started toward the door her jaw began to quiver ten feet fifteen twenty she heard a noise perhaps a footstep john the terrified echo of her own voice came back to her from three directions and it seemed as if there were a trio of ghosts in the room mocking her the tears came more quickly she forced herself with all her will to walk slowly then nina was almost at the front door arch beyond it she could see the glint of the chain on the door this reassured her and the terror diminished pellam would be returning any minute she could the hand slipped around her mouth and held her firmly she tasted tobacco and salt another arm curled around the chest and yanked her off her feet the man threw her to the ground the air knocked from her lungs she uttered a painful moan her breath came in small gasps then he was kneeling beside her his face very close to hers fourteen she lay on the floor on wood as cold as iron the narrow door admitted only reflected light from the main room and she was in shadow she smelled garbage and urine and mold and tasted her own metallic tears please she cried the man stood and walked to the outer door only a part of her rational mind was working and this portion believed that hed simply taken her purse and was leaving she saw his dark silhouette at the front door the chained door looking out then he slowly turned and walked back to her he crouched down and a band of pale light fell across his face he was wearing rosecolored sunglasses she saw his face clearly beneath his trim hair he was young he was handsome he was white all of these surprised her and lessened her fear slightly on his cheek was a large oval birthmark or discoloration the light startled him he had not expected to be seen her fear returned he was going to kill her because she had seen him whatever else he did he was going to kill her afterwards he ran his hand along her pale cheek put your hands under you she did not understand and he repeated the words calmly when she still did not comprehend this instruction he illustrated lifting up her hips and shoving her hands beneath her buttocks maybe he wanted her hands pinned so she could not scratch him he bent down kneeling and put his mouth next to her ear nina twisted her head away wincing and expecting to be kissed she felt the heat of his breath please she cried dont i have a message for your friend she did not hear this please listen are you listening she nodded crying again mr crimmins knows that your friend saw him in the car that night you tell him that if he testifies ill come back you understand what im saying what did you hear me nina said mr crimmins and if i come back he touched her cheek again youre not going to like it ninas body was racked with sobbing he said dont move for a half hour stay right where you are he stood up she heard no footsteps nor did she hear the rattle of the chain on the front door because of this she believed he was still there watching her perhaps hidden in the shadows only ten feet away she stared at the distant square of greasy glass lit by the sun and the thin auras encircling it the rings of red light that her tears created he found her sitting curled up outside the factory staring down at the branchcracked sidewalk at her feet nina she did not look up not for a moment when she did it was with eyes full of tears he sensed she had been assembling herselfforcing herself to be placid john her voice broke with sobbing she was shivering what is it he crouched next to her her arms hugged him hard and she was shaking hysterically there was a man pellam stiffened he took her by the shoulders what happened sobbing again he had to wait he wanted to shake it out of her force her to tell him but he waited nina pulled away and roughly wiped her earwhere the attackers mouth had beenas if scraping the skin clean he didnt do anything he just knocked me down lets call the cops pellam started to stand he said he told me tb tell you something me he said he worked for the man you saw the man in the lincoln and if you tell the police hed come back and crimmins he said the name was his hands began to quiver in rage then his neck he couldnt control it then his jaw and head shaking uncontrollably he blinked his eyes watered with the fury his jaw suddenly cramped and he realized his teeth were jammed together john lets call the police she shook her head no what we have to no john please he didnt hurt me not really but im scared of him he said hed come back she looked at him with frightened wet round eyes please just take me home pellam looked around the field and brush surrounding the factory he thought back to the dark car that had cruised past while they were on the street all his enemies in this town were faceless where were they pellam thought momentarily of his distant ancestor wild bill who fought it out with gunfighters facetoface and no more than a dozen feet apart except of course for the last one the one who shot him in the back this guy what did he look like pellam asked she described him as best she could the hair the youthfulness the pink glasses she thought for a moment and described his pants and jacket she could not remember his shoes or shirt theres something else about him what pellam helped her to her feet he had a red mark on his cheek like a big birthmark it looked like that red spot on jupiter she touched her own cheek jupiter the planet nina said will you please take me home now i dont need a goddamn appointment pellam shoved the door open it swung into a bookshelf a precariously balanced volume tumbled to the bare floor with the sound of a gunshot he stopped four people gazed at him three were astonished us attorney ronald peterson looked calmly at pellam as he walked farther into the room the others two men and a woman were young their eyes danced between the intruder and peterson pellam ignored them and said i want to talk to you now ten minutes you mind peterson asked his coterie even if they had he was obviously their boss and the only debate they were presented was whether it was better protocol to take their files or leave them the papers remained where they were and the youngsters walked silently out of the room pellam put his hands on the cluttered desk knocking aside a windup set of dentures he leaned forward i want protection for myself my friends and for everybody with the film company a friend of mine was just attacked i want an agent at her apartment now she lives in cranston on have a seat mr pellam pellam remained standing glancing from the windup toy collection into the mans serene olive pits of eyes the us attorney motioned to a chair please pellam sat down you say she was attacked this friend of yours pellam told him about the factory and the man with the birthmark crimmins petersons troubled eyes scanned the colorful foliage outside his window he spat out that son of a bitch your agents told me hed hired some hit man in chicago or detroit or something thiss him this is the guy i want protection protection agents pellam exploded you know bodyguards us marshals thats a lot of taxpayers money to devote to protecting someone youve got this witness protection ah the keyword witness pellam said look youre playing a game you know his name crimmins go arrest him peterson said im confused if you didnt see him why would he threaten you well he doesnt know i didnt see anything why are you hesitating you want crimmins hes just threatened me and assaulted my friend go arrest him the attack that you say pellam was on his feet i say my friend peterson held up a hand excuse me my mistake i apologize pleasehave a seat pellam sat down the us attorney said what exactly do you want i want protection i keep saying that i suppose we could put one man on it for a while but what happened to your friend isnt a federal crime its an assault theres no federal jurisdiction you mean its not a crime to threaten a federal witness his voice faded in reverse proportion to petersons smile we come back to that again see what im saying youre not a witness no jurisdiction theres nothing we can do pellams voice was soft thats the kind of technicality you people like to use peterson paused a moment maybe wondering which category the you people described the point is even if we got a conviction for this attack the best we could do is put him away for a year tops hed be out and after you again twice as mad or after your friend bullshit peterson pressed an intercom button a middleaged woman in a white blouse and tan skirt appeared in the doorway yessir bring me the crimmins file please all of it mr peterson no sorry just the background file the first redweld he looked at pellam you really dont know who peter crimmins is well let me tell you secondgeneration russian ukrainian i mean i suppose we have to be careful with that nowadays he made a lot of money in the trucking business and we know that hes built up a huge moneylaundering operation it was some people that work for him got into a battle with a jamaican street gang in east st louis pellam pictured the windup toys strolling off the edge of the desk and some young assistant attorney scurrying to retrieve them from the floor what exactly twelve people were killed peterson frowned but did not seem to be particularly shocked or mournful whats that got to do with me massacre thats what the postdispatch said not exactly hyperbole seven of them were bystanders tough luck in an election year peterson was immobile for a moment he lifted a very white finger to his earlobe and stroked it absently three times when he spoke his voice was temperate the office of us attorney is an appointed position pellam gazed at him skeptically i have no aspirations to be mayor of this city or governor of the state or senator i have yet to understand why anyone would want to be a representative the secretary appeared and set a large bartered redbrown file folder on petersons desk the us attorney opened the file and pulled out a number of stacks of papers and clippings he upended one stack on his lap and began flipping through it squinting the pictures spun out flying like frisbees pellam glanced at them he was surprised they were in color for some reason he had assumed police photographers used blackandwhite film he was surprised at how bright the blood was he had seen bodies before blood in real life seemed darker those were tenyearold boys though its hard to tell after what happened to them pellam picked up the glossy photos and tossed them back to peterson one fell on the floor the us attorney picked it up and stared at it two years ago we were very close to indicting peter crimmins on several racketeering counts we had a material witness a young woman a secretary who could implicate crimmins there was a freak accident somehow a pot of boiling water fell off the stove thirddegree burns on her groin and thighs she said she was cooking peterson s voice rose into an eerie wail thirddegree burns her skin was like cooked steak the eyes glowed but you know what was odd what was very odd the accident happened at midnight peterson lifted his palms my wife doesnt cook at midnight do you know anybody who cooks at midnight pellam was silent petersons head bobbled with rage slowly he calmed he took a kleenex and wiped his face the woman recanted her testimony before trial so what youre telling me is that crimmins is a bad man who has a track record of scaring witnesses mr pellam there is no doubt in my mind that he was the person who killed vince gaudia he had the motive he does not have a convincing alibi he has ordered people threatened beaten and killed in the past look what he did to your girlfriend the fact is that the rico charges ive got against crimmins are nothing without gaudia hell get three or four years at the most pellam saw more sweat on the dome of petersons head he saw the finger and thumb rubbing together compulsively trembling pellams voice was patient and tired i cant help you peterson came back to earth he opened another file folder and preoccupied dug inside pellam asked what about protecting nina i think shed be safer if she left town there isnt much we can do i know some reporters pellam said ominously they might be interested in this story you refusing to protect people unless they testify for you peterson slipped an utterly goodnatured smile into position on his eggshaped face oh i dont think thatd be a very good story you never know peterson lifted several pieces of paper out of the file the problem with reporters he said flipping through the sheets is that they like the lowest denominators of any situation this witness story of yours isnt really a grabber pellam waved an arm in frustration and started toward the door this story the us attorney said with a smile would be much better the bulletin left petersons hand and floated down to the desk the california bear seal was in the upper lefthand corner and in the center of the white wrinkled sheet were two photos and several brief paragraphs the photos werent of peter crimmins or of live gangsters or dead bystanders but were of john pellam himself he looked exhausted puffyeyed unshaven they showed him from two anglesstraight on and in profile beneath them were words in slightly uneven lines suggesting that they were typed by a cheap typewriter among these words were pellams name vital statistics the date the photo was taken and the names of several los angeles county sheriffs department deputies at the bottom of the bulletin was this information charged with murder manslaughter salepossession of controlled substances fifteen does your boss know you did time pellam lowered his hand from the doorknob he returned to petersons desk and sat down he stared at the picture turn your head we want a profile turn your head him yeah hes the one killed that actor yep sure is peterson said cheerfully you know i seem to remember something of surety law wouldnt your film companys bond get lifted if an exfelon was on the payroll especially with a drug charge i was acquitted on the drug and murder charges dont quibble mr pellam the victim died because you delivered two ounces of cocaine to him didnt you this tommy bernstein the young man in question the best friend in question pellam reached forward and touched the photo of himself put this here jumpsuit on then we cuff you and take you downstairs you hassle us we hassle you and we gotbatons and you dont you know what im saying now move the reason that he had not been able to attend tommys memorial service was that he was in a los angeles county sheriffs department holding cell pending arraignment pellam staring at his own gaunt image was long past feeling the need to explain to shake his head with a grim tight mouth and tell how tommy had begged him for the stuff crying please just this once john help me help me help me i cant work without it i see the cameras man and i freeze i mean i fucking freeze you gotta help me tommy bernstein lovable madman and brilliant actor leaning on pellams shoulder tears in thick streaks shooting down his doughy face pathetic and looking just like the child that in the core of his soul he was and would always bethe child that pellam should have recognized no he wouldnt explain this to the sour cold man he now sat in front of he said only it was a long time ago peterson regarded him coolly an exfelon is an exfelon you cant ever take that away no you cant peterson repeated does your boss know no its purely a civil matter i dont have any legal duty to tell him but i do feel a certain sense of moral obligation he would fire you in an instant i imagine i imagine he would and if i say that i saw crimmins in the car youll forget to mention it youve had some conversations with a marty weller in the past week marty how do you know about marty some conversations about a movie project youre putting together pellam was silent and peterson continued following those conversations you started looking for some money your bank in sherman oaks some car dealer who wasnt interested in an apparently lessthanperfect porsche you happen to own you tapped my phone illegally not at all we talk to people thats all we introduce ourselves and we ask questions most people usually cooperate whats your point you apparently need some money some big money and you need it rather desperately and you think crimmins is paying me not to testify yes thats exactly what i think anger sputtered into pellams face he stood up and leaned forward his eyes wild and uncontrolled his right fist balled papers and toys cascaded to the floor they remained locked in a gaze for a long moment while peterson mastered his fear and pellam his anger pellam was close to hitting the man peterson whispered please i say this for your sake i dont think you want to add to your list of woes at the moment do you really pellam finally stood upright and walked not to the door but to the window for a long moment as if he were debating something furiously he looked out over an expanse of green st louis was a very verdant place even in october the important aspects of his life in jeopardy pellam noticed small details like the colors of foliage and the shape of trees he nodded suddenly but whatever decision he came to he kept to himselfand walked out of petersons office without saying a word the ribbed ball rolled along the small grass rectangle you lose the old man told peter crimmins who smiled and nodded to the other players and then stepped over the blackpainted railing he stood in a small park in a suburb of st louis squinting toward a huge complex of redbrick apartments he wondered how much money it cost to build the place he had never been in real estate he considered it too jewish but he had lately been thinking about building something he wanted some legacy and he thought he would like to sink some of his vast funds into something that might be named after him joshua stood nearby leaning against a lamp pole with the tough serenity of middleaged bouncers and secret service agents a broadfeatured woman in a blue denim cowboy suit talked into a public phone and gestured wildly her fat fingers mauled a cigarette crimmins wearing dark slacks and sandals and a white dress shirt had been playing boccie for an hour at one time the largely italian park would probably have been crowded on a pleasant afternoon hke this though even crimmins who had lived all his life near here could not recall when perhaps the year of the st louis exposition an era when the town still retained some of its confederateness why there were even homeless people camped out near swing sets crimmins did not approve of homelessness he thought such people should pick themselves up and get a job as those in earlier eras would have done bootstraps was a word peter crimmins used often he surveyed the park now lots of negroes prowling slowly on their bicycles or walking in that fast lope of theirs puerto ricans white teenagers in leather and greasy denim with their frisbees and skateboards and guitars a few professional people women jogging while they pushed babies in strollers that had three huge cushioned wheels and then there were the chinese while crimmins disliked jews and feared negroes and puerto ricans he loathed the chinese crimmins was now looking at four or five asian families as they picnicked crimmins was aware of the tide real estate and electronics shipping soon and money laundering not long after that a boy on a skateboard snapped past him in a surfer s crouch as if drawn by the youngsters wake a darkcomplected man suddenly stepped up to crimmins hold up there just as suddenly joshua was between them appearing from nowhere hand inside his jacket police big fellow the man said unless youre feeling yourself up get your fucking hand out where i can see it shields and id cards appeared im gianno maddox police thats detective hagedorn over there maddox crimmins spat out hagedorn stood nearby his jacket was unbuttoned gianno said wed like to ask you a few questions crimmins nodded to joshua who retreated he stopped fifteen feet away and stood watching the three men a woman was attacked not long ago someone i know crimmins was concerned well not a friend of yours thats for sure she was apparendy reluctant to file a report we got a notice of the assault from the fbi why would an assault be a federal issue thought crimmins reciter of indictments and an expert in federal law then he understood i see he said wearily and you think i was behind this attack she gave us a statement that the attacker said he worked for you crimmins blinked me gianno gave him a description of a young man with the birthmark i dont know anyone who looks like that besides i wouldnt threaten anyone no gianno laughed of course not where have you been today hagedorn piped up home then i came here had to make some phone calls that nobody could hear did you gianno nodded toward the public phone crimmins rubbed his finger and thumb together in irritation the thumbnail turned white under the pressure are you arresting me hagedorn said will you give us a list of all your employees i dont think i have to do that we hoped youd be cooperative gianno said it would look better his partner offered i dont really care what anything looks like i gianno said to hagedorn lets get out of here this guys no help well follow up with pellam the blond detective wagged a subtle finger and his partner stopped speaking as if he had caught himself at a social blunder they looked for a moment at crimmins who kept his face blank the two policemen then walked away when the detectives had turned the corner crimmins walked along the street away from the phone booth motioning joshua after him when the bodyguard caught up with him there was a crown of sweat on crimminss forehead and his face was white these were not the symptoms of physical exertion find me stettle crimmins growled in a furious whisper i dont care where he is what hes doing i want him now the river was muddy today the water seemed no more turbulent than on any other daythe wind was brisk but it still hadnt broken the surface into whitecaps but some disturbance was churning up clayish mud and staining the wide water from shore to shore john pellam stretched out in the drivers seat of the camper and tried ninas number once more her machine answered and he hung up without leaving a message they had had a brief conversation earlier during which she assured him she was fine she simply wanted rest could he call the head of makeup and explain of course he would was there anything else he could do did she want company no shed visited her mother at the hospital and asked the womans doctor for a couple of valium for herself pellam could hear the slurred words and he hung up to let her get some sleep he had just now replaced the phone when a very distraught tony sloan called and said the final shoot was about to go down pellam knew this and had planned on attending what was ominous was that sloan had summoned him so adamantly he couldnt possibly be thinking of new locations could he the key grip had let slip the information that sloan had fifteen straight days of filmthat was twentyfourhour days of celluloidto boil down into a minute movie pellam thanking the lord he was not sloans film editor promised he would be there before the last blank gun shot was fired he stood up and adjusted his abel gance napoleon poster the only decoration in the camper he slipped the colt into the inside pocket of his bomber jacket and was about to leave when his phone buzzed again nina he asked are you sitting down the voice was a mans hello sitting down i can hardly hear you marty where are you im in berlin pellam pressed the cellular phone hard into his ear as if that might improve the connection from the state of missouri in which winston churchill coined the term iron curtain to the place that had once been behind it i tried to get you in london and paris pellam shouted look im sorry about the other night you dont have to shout you break up when you shout i can hear you fine what im sorry i missed you i had an accident well it was a damn expensive accident telorian was interested but he got pissed because you blew him off a second time whats the trouble john some freudian thing against iranians excuse me persians you shouldve called are you sitting down what do you mean ive got some hungarian money lined up what i know its weird paramount balked at the last minute on the terrorist script its totally cratered so its a green light for central standard time this guy in london put me in touch with these investors in budapest theyre a real east village duo young guys i pitched you sort of as a jarmusch hungarians financing a cult film noir flick set in wisconsin so this was the new world order well im happy about that marty what do we do now you can get a hundred fifty if i hustle well hustle boy they understand im directing theyre all for it they know all about you john its not a problem his voice filled with transatlantic sincerity you know what im saying the death of tommy bernstein was what he was saying they like your work they like you or who they think you are dont disappoint them who are these guys their names you mean unpronounceable funny marks over the letters who cares get your money im having my shyster in new york put together the partnership agreement lets try to sign it up by the first of the month is it doable its doable its very doable listen marty thanks you know what this means to me the broken connection mercifully cut short the gratitude and pellam found the conversation was over outside he kicked a piece of dried mud off his nokonas and walked to the yamaha sixteen we saw your advisory about the assault on that sassower women ronald peterson cocked an eyebrow at bob gianno and we talked to crimmins neither of the maddox cops noticed petersons eyes flick with minute satisfaction toward nelson who could not restrain the less subtle smile hagedorn continued he denied having anything to do with the assault of course what did you expect what indeed but naturally we didnt care about that we just wanted to flush him we mentioned pellams name we pretended it was a slip you should have seen his eyes peterson said that was a clever move we thought so hell do something now either try to hit pellam directly or just spook him either way well move on him they sat in petersons office the cops had noticed the toy collection and each seemed to be trying to think of something witty to say about it and came up blank peterson was oh so happy with their immense discomfort keeping the pressure on pellam thats good peterson took a long moment to read a lowpriority report that had nothing to do with this meeting he dashed a note in the margin and dropped it on the desk you know pellam did time what hagedorn laughed manslaughter san quentin damn san quentin gianno said hard time how bout that peterson watched the local detectives stew a bit as they were poked by guilt that they themselves hadnt unearthed this information he asked can you use that he himself had considered pellams criminal record and concluded that local police couldnt do much with it hagedorn and gianno looked at each other the blond goodlooking copmore handsome than most of the fbi agents who worked for petersonlifted his hands and scrunched his lips together in reflection finally he said i dont see how film permits are already issued i mean i dont think a prior conviction has any bearing on that but what about parole parole hagedorn continued did he break parole by leaving the state this was something peterson had not thought of a microscopic frown crossed his brow being outthought by this smarmy shittown cop peterson decided that nelson would twist in the wind a few revolutions for missing this given the dates of the crime and his travelingman career i doubt thats an issue but ill have my associate check into it now i think weve agreed that crimmins knows pellam reported him for the assault on the girl andthanks to the clever thinking of our friends from maddox herehe may make some overt move against pellam well monitor that but i think we need to step up the pressure too any ideas gianno asked glumly suspecting sarcasm but unable to identify it peterson responded i have one yes two of my agents were on the movie set the other day and they found something interesting id like to ask them to stop by and tell us about it missouri river blues scene eexterior dayroad between field and river this is a narrow road between the field and the river there is a small onestory church an the river side road surrounded by b ushes and trees past the bushes the road continues through the field open space on either side medium angles of bosss packard parked fifty feet past the church dehlia dabs fake blood on her forehead and stretches out in the front seat of the car with the door open ross and the three gang members take their machine guns and hide in the bushes waiting for the armored truck ross stops and runs back to dehlia he gives her his favorite pistol ross in a half hour little love were gonna be across that river and were gonna be free dehlia if anything happens two shot of ross touching his finger to her lips to shush her they kiss long and then he stands up cocks the machine gun and runs to the bushes finale time everybody lets try to bring it in under a hundred takes tony sloan took his position standing in the shadow of a big thirteenton chapman titan motorized crane he surveyed the battlefield to be sloan the secondunit director the dp the evernervous ponytailed assistant director and the stunt coordinator had just finished trooping through the weeds and grass and scrabbling over the revetment of stone down to the yellowish water blocking out the climax of the movie this was the armored truck attack the owners of the transport company tipped that the truck would be hit by rosss gang had replaced the shipment of cash with bags of cutup newspaper and substituted pinkerton agents for the regular guards dehlia would be reclining supposedly injured helpless and beautiful at the scene of the fake car accident bringing the armored car to a stop but before ross could slip a smoke grenade into one of the trucks gunports the guards were to come out blazing pious citizens just leaving a church at the wrong moment became pious victims as they walked into the middle of the carnage ross and dehlia would then escape but they would drive only a half mile down the road before a young boywhose father ross had accidentally killed fifty scenes beforedarted in front of them ross would swerve and the car would sail into the river pellam had suggested they rename the film the postman always rings twice for the wild bunch more than one hundred crew members and thirty actors and extras tested lights oiled dollies adjusted hydraulic lifts plugged in cables mounted film magazines prefocused cameras took light readings positioned microphones and read and reread scripts but the man of the moment was none of these nor was he the lean wildhaired director of photography or even tony sloan himself the center of this afternoons particular universe was a thin balding fiftyoneyearold man of quiet demeanor wearing neither period costume nor hollywood chic but dark polyester slacks a neatly pressed blue dress shirt and penny loafers there was a delicacy about henry stacey known both here and in hollywood only by his nickname stace his careful eyes scanned the set in front of him with the attention of a seasoned cinematographer his job was in fact considerably less artistic although it wasin the mind of directors like tony sloan and most of sloans fansfar more important than the director of photographys stace was the companys arms master the actors and actresses in missouri river blues had so far fired close to seventy thousand rounds of blank ammunition at each other which probably far exceeded the total number of live rounds fired by all the reallife crooks and law enforcers in the show me state since it joined the union the arms and prop assistants had been working srnce four that morning supervising the loading of an armorys worth of submachine guns rifles and pistols for the final scene stace himself oversaw the loading of every weapon to make certain that no live ammunition accidentally got mixed into the magazines he also had worked with the unit director and his assistants to oversee the placing of hundreds of impact squibstiny electrically detonated firecrackerswhose explosions would resemble striking bullets he did the same with wardrobe and makeup to rig the blood bladders on the bodies of actors destined to be wounded or killed in the shoot and who stood with great discomfort as they unprotected were wired up by assistants who wore thick gloves and safety goggles the squibs were connected to a computerized control panel and could be triggered either by an operator or with additional rigging by the trigger action of the gun that was supposedly firing the bullets whose impact the squibs represented stace and his crew also rigged debris mortars and vaporized gasoline bombs for the shots in which the mockups of the antique cars exploded reminding actors and actresses to stuff their ears with cotton before the filming was another part of the job as was instructing them how to work the guns how to stand when they fired and reminding them to provide the gunbucking recoil that occurs only with live ammunition he had running battles with sloan as he did with all directors because he urged the actors to point the muzzles slightly away from their victims for safety while the directors for the sake of authenticity wanted guns aimed directly at their targets a competitive and awardwinning pistol marksman stace was also the set rifleman occasionally manning his own boltaction or m automatic to fire wax bullets for impact effects on surfaces that couldnt be rigged with squibswindows water or even if they volunteered a stuntmans bare flesh the final scene in missouri river would involve the firing of five thousand rounds in several setups once the medium and longangle shooting was finished the rigging would be done once more for the closeup and twoshot angles this was going to be a long day the exhausted key grip looked over the prep work then at his watch man well be fighting the light on this one meaning working until dusk are we ready sloan shouted through his megaphone various crew members not knowing whether or not they were the subject of this inquiry assured him that they were stace checked the location of every weapon noting it on a clipboard and walked back to the fiberboard table on which was the squib control board three of his assistants sat like puppeteers both hands above rows of buttons because the scene was newly added to the script and was so elaborate there had been no time to rig the guns themselvesto fire the squibs the young assistantstwo men and a womanwould use their judgment in deciding where the machinegun bullets would land and push the corresponding buttons stace said ready okay the unit director shouted everybody in position dehlia sprawled out of the open door of a muddy packard the pinkerton agents piled into the armored truck and it backed down the road the parishioners walked into the church rosss soontobedead fellow gangsters checked the harnesses and cables that would jerk them backward as they were shot by the agents the director of photography and the camera operator climbed into the chapman cranes twin seats and rose twenty feet into the air sloan released his own death grip on the boom and wandered over to the unit director pep talk stace wryly whispered to his assistants sloan lifted his megaphone his voice crackled could i have everybodys attention please quiet please id just like to say one thing this next eight minutes is costing me a quarter of a million dollars dont fuck up pep talk he returned to his place beside the crane the unit director nodded to the senior gaffer the lights clicked on replacing the mute aura of overcast sunlight with a wash of light that seemed to bleach the colors out of the scene but that would translate into natural sunlight by the time technicolor was through with the film the temperature on the set immediately rose five degrees and kept going cameras rolling assistants stepped in front of each camera and snapped clappers action the unit director shouted the bulky gray armored truck eased along the dirt road passing the church then slowing as it neared the packard it stopped dehlia lifted her head stained with the phony blood and motioned for help the driver and the frontseat guard hesitated they mouthed words to themselves they spoke into the back of the truck the front doors slowly opened the guards stepped out onto the road ross lit a smoke bomb and ran crouching toward the back of the truck now the driver shouted pulling a machine gun from the front seat the back doors of the armored truck burst open parishioners stepped from the church smiling and nodding the two guards began firing at ross and the other gangsters who were approaching from a stand of trees tree branches snapped dirt puffed up signs were riddled the side of the truck was dotted with bullet holes bodies of gangsters flew backwards churchgoers littered the ground go go go tony sloan was mouthing beautiful dehlia was trying to start the packard ross was covering her and retreating the other gangsters fell back the preacher came out onto the steps he was brandishing a bible a guard accidentally gunned him down stone cold beautiful sloan whispered it was into the middle of this battledirectly between the warring factionsthat two modern navy blue sedans and a white ford econoline van skidded to a halt men in suits climbed out leisurely examining the set with some amusement sloans mouth opened in astonishment everyone began talking at oncemany of them shouting because of their earplugs jesus christ sloan shouted no one had any trouble hearing this who the hell are you the unit director was too shocked to order the cameras shut off finally the assistant director holding her ponytail in a death grip woke out of her stunned silence and shouted cut cut save the lights the huge lights clicked off the assistant whose job it was to keep the road closed ran onto the set sloan pierced her with a glance of hatred they came right at me she sobbed they wouldnt stop a tall grayhaired man climbed from the first sedan looking around when he saw the director he stepped toward him what sloan said in gods name are you doing do you have any idea of what youve just done his face was crimson an id card appeared im agent mclntyre you in charge who are you were agents with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms department of the treasury weve been informed by the us attorney in st louis that youre in possession of unregistered automatic weapons and were here to confiscate them you cant do that clear the chambers on those weapons mclntyre shouted to the actors put the safeties on and set them in the van here sloan stormed up to mclntyre who ignored him another man got out of the car studying the smoke and destruction around him detective bob gianno looked at the director are you anthony sloan damn right i am do you know what youve just cost me this scene youre under arrest for violation of the missouri state laws governing possession of illegal weapons would you hold out your hands please seventeen stace stacey smoothed the tufts of graying hair above his ears and said with utter calm im afraid youve made a mistake he sat in the office of ronald peterson beside him was a fidgeting furious tony sloan who stared with particular contempt at the collection of windup toys littering petersons desk mistake peterson asked stace oh i dont think so but first i want to make perfectly clear that you are not being charged with any federal crime whatsoever we have noticed an apparent violation of federal law but are withholding any decision taproceed under missouri law possession of automatic weapons not registered by the batf is a state violation our colleagues in maddox have decided theres probable cause for your arrest theyre the ones whove acted on that it was not a federal agency youre a prick sloan said you understand what im saying to you peterson cocked an eyebrow enthusiastically i understand that well never make a movie again in this state thats what i understand peterson shrugged youre not under arrest so you can speak to me without a lawyer present i understand already sloan barked please continue mr stacey im qualified as a classthree federal firearms dealer stace set a small piece of paper on the desk next to a tiny walking football thats my license i think you know perfectly well almost all property and arms masters in hollywood are classthree dealers peterson glanced at the license momentarily i dont doubt you sir its the weapons im concerned about every one of those guns is registered tax stamps have been duly bought and i have a right to transport them over state lines the actually thats not quite accurate batf notice is required no sir it is accurate diminutive stace stacey clearly dominated the conversation despite his calm unfazed voice the notice is generated by the firearms rental company i rented those weapons from culver city arms and props theyre on the motion picture association computer link to batfs washington office im surprised i have to be telling this to a us attorney peterson took scrupulous notes he looked up frowning unfortunately we can find no record of the notice im a good friend of steve marring in the batf district office on the coast i suggest you give him a call immediately it wasnt a batfinitiated operation several fbi agents were on the set looking for one of your employees pellam sloan spat out peterson hesitated and then said coquettishly yes as a matter of fact it was mr pellam how did you know that sloan sloeeyed with fatigue rubbed the bridge of his nose when he did not respond peterson continued my agents noticed the machine guns and reported their presence to me naturally were concerned about such weapons failing into irresponsible hands stace said pleasantly i heard not too long ago about a man in san francisco selling fully automatic uzis to high school students id think you might be more concerned about situations like that a tragedy im sure but my bailiwick is missouri ive had about enough of this sloan shouted youve cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars im calling my lawyer peterson shook his head mr sloan oh by the way i really enjoyed helicop i figure it cost me about two hundred bucks after buying the kids all those toys for christmas but i did enjoy that movie why are you doing this to me are we reaching an understanding peterson asked heartily understanding have i explained to you how i learned about those weapons i have havent i sloan had calmed down there was a cryptic tone in the conversation reminiscent of what one heard in offices and restaurants throughout beverly hills and west hollywood it was very zento speak while not speaking pellam why dont you talk to him mr sloan just talk to him see if he can remember anything about what happened that night of the gaudia murder he looked at stace you talk about uzis in san francisco well mr pellam can help us put away a man whos been doing a lot worse than that but without his help that mans going to go free and a lot more people are going to get hurt sloan said i understand pellam claims he didnt see anything claims well i know he claims he didnt see anything why is he holding out the director wondered maybe hes afraidalthough ive assured him we can protect him my personal feeling is hes being paid off no dont protest too fast youd be surprised what people will do for money he is after all an exconvict what sloan whispered san quentin served almost a year i assumed you knew stace folded his hands in his lap he stared directly into petersons eyes john pellam is a good man he had some trouble weve all had trouble at times you knew about it sloan shouted to the arms master and you didnt goddamn tell me stace stacey was not an employee of missouri river partnership and tony sloan was only one of nearly thirty directors who regularly hired him sloan was also among these clients the largest pain in the ass he now easily won a staredown with the director and smiled sadly as if embarrassed at the mans childishness manslaughter peterson said pleased that sloan had lost yet another round at this meeting stace said he did his time he got out he was a good director then hes a good location scout now pellam directed why didnt i know this you were probably making runningshoe commercials in new york at the time stace offered without a hint of discernible irony peterson jotted a note ill check out what youve told me about your guns mr stacey and if youre correct you can pick them up first thing on tuesday morning and the state charges will be dropped stace said i am correct sir and id advise you to release them to me right now tuesday sloan blurted i cant wait three days were already overbudget were but unfortunately peterson explained its saturday theres no one in the washington office of course tomorrows sunday and monday columbus day sloan closed his eyes christ why did you wait until this morning youve known we had the guns for two three days his eyes were on sloan do you think were reaching an understanding do you sloans anger was diminishing maybe possibly stace began to speak what you seem to be suggesting is it was sloan who silenced him with a wave of the hand peterson said then if theres nothing else gentlemen oh as a show of good faith ill talk to those city detectives ill recommend youre released on your own recognizance i appreciate that you seem like a reasonable man one more thing mr sloan peterson slid a piece of paper toward the director any chance of an autograph you know for the boys the fbi again the severe rapping on the camper door sounded just like that of federal agents but pellam was running up a long list of potentially hostile visitors so who could tell when he opened the door he held the colt peacemaker hidden beneath his black comme des garcons sports jacket tony sloan nodded a greeting as he walked inside without waiting for an invitation pellam thought about making a wisecrack like waking the dead referring both to the pounding and to the deceased ross and dehlia but tony sloans expression was far too grim for jokes and all pellam said was come on in after sloan already was sloan walked directly to the counter where sat a bottle of bourbon he poured two glasses you were at the shoot got there late but i heard some problem with the guns sloan gave him a brief account of the events that culminated in bis handcuffing my god pellam whispered stace is a very buttonedup guy i cant imagine he made a mistake like that sloan was strangely pensive his eyes did not flit around the camper they were sedate they were almost sad the director inhaled the whiskey fumes and drank down half the glass okay john no bullshit just tell me did you see that guy pellam thought he meant the cop who arrested him i told you i got there late i the man in the lincoln is what im talking about is that why youre here pellam laughed you ve been talking to who the detectives in maddox no of course not he thought peterson youve been talking to peterson john they can close down production for three days if that happens the studio or completion bonds going to take over this movie might not get done if id seen him i wouldve told somebody i wouldve told everybody look tony thiss extortion on tuesday petersonll say sorry we made a mistake call the studios legal department call hank john whats this about the money money i hear youre trying to put something together with marty weller youre looking for some bucks i am that has nothing to do with you or anybody else here somebody paying you so you wont testify john pellam lowered his head slightly and eased a long breath of whiskeyscented air into his lungs i think maybe you and i dont have much more to talk about no sloan leaned forward pointing a nubby finger at pellam we got one thing more to talk about you tell peterson that it was this peter crimmins in the lincoln i dont care whether you saw him or not i know he was in the car and i dont even know who the fuck he is sorry tony how much is he paying you ill ask you to leave now you want to stay on this job and get your fee youll tell peterson what he wants to know thats money you owe me if i cant wrap this picture in three days there wont be any money for anybody thats not my fault i did my job sell one of your ferraris and pay me sloan set the glass down on the campers tiny counter he seemed calm but the tendons in his neck were bulging and pronounced just beneath his dark beard his teeth were set oh i got your number pellam he said viciously i asked around about you you and your artsy films you and your cahier du cinema you and your buddies sitting around and talking about cannes and auteur theory you make your jokes you make the crew giggle bonnie and clyde the wild bunch but just tell me pellam how many of those crew people are you paying how many of their kids are you putting through college how many people came to see your runs and how many come to see mine pellams last film as director central standard time was never finished it would have starred tommy bernstein who died of a massive cocaineinduced heart attack on the set during the second week of principal photography the film pellam had directed just prior to that had won a palme dor at cannes but was seen by north americans only in new york montreal toronto los angeles and in those cities with video stores that indulged in cult films what tony sloan was saying now was absolutely correct pellam said evenly i wont tell peterson i saw who was in the car then youre fired clear out get the paperwork and any equipment of the companys to stile hes taking over as location manager ill sue you tony i dont want to but i will if this film doesnt wrap pellam im coming after you for my fee thats a million seven and even if i lose youll piss away a half million in lawyers fees alone you dont respect who i am pellam okay but you got no right to cut my legs out from underneath me did you know this ralph bales asked stevie flom looked at the offered page of the maddox reporter and could not figure out what he was supposed to know i read the postdispatch mostly okay it was in the postdispatch too ill bet see its the associated press that means a lot of papers get it they were on the riverfront in st louis the silvery arch towering over them and looking lofty and weird at the same time like a huge toy in front of them unhealthylooking water buish and milky splashed at pilings from the speakers of a candy red excursion boat a paddlewheeler came brassy jazz ralph bales had been reading when stevie flom walked up to him reading and leaning up against the scabby railing really lost in the paper stevie flom was cold and he was not interested in what was in the paper he hadnt slept well the night before turning over and over listening to the wirttl rock the single tree outside his bedroom window hed stared at the tree for a long time when he had gone to bed there were seventeen leaves on it when he had wakened there were eight his wife had slept with a smile on her face and that pissed him off then she woke up cheerful and happy and that pissed him off too what it was he was supposed to know about was this airplane that took off vertically then the wings twisted forward and it flew like a normal plane that is a great idea ralph bales pointed at an abandoned dock beside the river see it could land there you wouldnt have to go out to lambert thats the biggest pain in traveling getting to the airports you ask me stevie flom didnt travel much reno of course then he and some of the guys had gone to a casino in puerto rico once hed taken the wife to aruba which was nothing but sand and wind and as hot as an engine block he wondered why ralph bales traveled so much he had to worry about getting to the airport i wish i had a piece of that yeah stevie flom said and he looked at the picture of the airplane which after a moment of reflection he decided was a pretty good idea he thought that with the money he was going to make from lombro he would take the wife on another vacation or maybe one of the girlfriends hed have to decide which one ive got the goahead ralph bales said he turned the paper to the front page where there were no airplanes or other clever ideas at all you got oh to take care of the guy in the camper the beer guy whyd it take so long lombro was nervous i dont know hes a weird dude is what he is yeah weird hes upped your share to ten ten thousand of course thousand what do you think well why stevie grinned deep creases into his babyskin cheeks why excuse me you want me to call him up and give it back im just curious curious hes curious ralph bales whispered youve got to make it look like an accident accident why because its got to thats why the extra money i was thinking maybe something with that motorcycle of his hes got a cycle that yellow yamaha he keeps it on the back of his camper sure stevie said a cycle accident thats easy lake he did it every day stevie flom thought maddox is an easy place to steal a car but a tough place to drive one around once youd boosted it the cops didnt have much else to do but check out hot cars and the place was hardly big enough to get lost in the camouflage of heavy traffic he was eyeballed by two cops as he made his lawabiding way out of town stevie was also unhappy that this particular dodges former owner was a rentacar company which meant that the fortyeight thousand miles on it were hard miles careless heavyfoot miles the damn thing rattled and clanked and there was a hiss coming from the ac even though it was off but it moved pretty fast and he was able to keep up with the cycle though the beer guy drove like a son of a bitch stevie worried that if the yamaha started lanehopping he could kiss the mans ass goodbye he goosed the accelerator and closed on the cycle he may have had a lemon car but stevie was lucky in one respect he had arrived at the bideawee trailer park just as the guy walked out of the camper and jumped on the yamaha hed even glanced at stevies car but just briefly not even looking in the drivers seat stevie drove past in the rearview mirror he watched the man kickstart the yamaha stevie made a slow uturn and followed now on the expressway the beer man changed lanes shot forward braked hard then settled into the express lane about twenty miles over the limit stevie hands sweating managed to keep with him and soon they were cruising smoothly toward st louis as he tapped his gold pinkie ring on the steering wheel stevie was thinking about his father he had a limited but severe repertoire of images of the old man and he realized now that some of them matched this fellow on the bike lean midthirties leather jacket cycle this thought put him in another bad mood and agitated stevie leaned forward to turn on the radio it was a digital model and he couldnt figure out how to set the station for the boss sound we rock st louis all the hits all the time the old radios you just twisted the dial to where you wanted it then pulled the button out and shoved it back in all this electronic stuff crap he kicked it hard with his boot heel and cracked the housing it kept playing something classical he kicked it again and plastic snapped and the speaker went silent except for a hiss stevie flom stopped worrying about music and concentrated on the motorcycle donnie buffett did not see her right away he opened his eyes and was afraid to move his head he thought it might make him vomit the motion he had been on pills for a flareup of pain in his shoulderthe gunshot woundand they made him nauseated im so sorry she said penny honey he lifted his hand out toward her andthis was the weird thingshe grabbed it in both hands and kissed his fingers then rubbed them against her cheek he looked at her as though he had not seen her for months as though he had never before seen her dark thick hair a narrow face pretty good figure bad posture shoulders forward to conceal large breasts of which she was selfconscious she wore clothes he knew she owned and had worn before but which werent familiar to him a gray suit an orange blouse lightcolored nylons buffett wished they had a child someone for penny to be with someone whom penny would have to be strong for she had strength somewhere in her he believed but she needed someone or something to bring it out she handed him a shopping bag she had baked him some cookies what he had told pellam was true she was a hell of a cook and brought another bag of ruffles potato chips and a container of sour king french onion dip a readers digest some crossword puzzle books donnie buffett had never done a crossword puzzle in his life she bent down and kissed him brothersister on the cheek he smelled her perfume buffett wondered if you got shot in the neck do you lose your sense of smell but of course he hadnt been shot in the neck he had just been shot in the back luckily he could still smell like a sonofabitch he looked at the crossword book thanks hon ive marked these for you she opened the readers digest for him my battle with leukemia there was another live your life days a year another article was from higher self magazine entitled joy go for it buffett looked at the food and penny said i dont know if you can eat those things sure its not like i had my appendix out or anything she nodded earnestly buffetts hair was a mess it fell across his forehead he was always pushing the dark strands off his face he did this now and his arm went out of control it crashed into the metal headboard of the bed shit he whispered pennys pretty face was shocked the nurse she said alarmed standing up abruptly looking for the call button im okay its nothing the pills im taking the nurse penny neither moved for a moment im so sorry stop saying that why are you saying that he opened the potato chips and ate a couple to show her that he liked them he could not bring himself to eat the dip then he ate a cookie they were good he ate another one the sweetness reminded him of his last supper the doughnut and coffee pellam had brought him he picked up the bag she had brought intending to set it on the floor beside the bed he felt the candle inside the bag he took it out penny i know what you think but it cant hurt and youve got oil too oil she stood and took the bag from him its wish oil wish oil what it is you pour some in the bathtub well i cant take a bath he was exasperated how can i take a bath she stared at him tears welling i dont think you have to put it in a bath i mean if it works in the bath itd work just as well dabbing it on you wouldnt it she added i know it works you keep wishing that youll get well put the oil on you then wish and wish and wish i meditated for an hour and seven minutes last night the terror hears this and rolls upright it starts to prowl through donnie buffetts guts sweat pops onto his forehead bleeding christ is it restless dodging around inside him playing with the pain in his legs slipping up to his heart dancing over his crotch cant get south of there can you you shit the terror he fights it down he presses his nails into the palm of his left hand he concentrates on the pain willing it to become a wave of agony this numbs the terror its prowling slows and it grows tired buffett begins to calm penny does not seem to notice her husband s absence and continues to talk about shopping and her parents and a consciousnessraising group shes been attending the terror finally falls asleep buffett took a deep breath and calmed down then interrupted her to say id like you to meet my doctor penny blinked buffett continued dr weiser shes the best in the city you know how i feel about doctors you need more than but i do need a doctor honey he said come on please just meet her okay she said cheerfully eyes sparkling id like that i promise i wont lecture her on what was she going to say on the right way to practice medicine holism spiritualism penny did not continue her thought but instead crossed her heart like a coy schoolgirl promise she nodded broadly acknowledging though she probably didnt know it her excessive sincerity there were some moments when penny appeared completely normal her hair would be shiny clean and curled nicely her facefrom the right anglewas soft her collar turned up covering the dark bones of her shoulders her hands would be folded the torn cuticles and ragged ripped nails were out of view a dancing light would be in her eyesa little mystified a little shy it was charming at those times donnie buffett remembered the woman he had fallen in love with he listened to her tell him about how she and her friends were going to be chanting for him chanting donnie buffett said and was suddenly tired exhausted he closed his eyes and suddenly all he wanted was to fall back to sleep the sleep in which he dreamed of pain flowing through muscles that now felt no pain fatigue wrapped around him sensuously and squeezed tight like a college girl making desperate love im beat honey he muttered pretending to doze you should sleep penny said she touched his hand uhhuh buffett almost opened his eyes and looked at her but he chose not to he felt momentarily guilty about this deception im a lucky man lucky lucky lucky i didnt get shot in the brain i didnt get shot in the heart i didnt get shot in the neck i can still smell and he could hear her voice in a detached little whisper you sleep now honey im going home he heard paper crinkle these are the instructions for the candle donnie buffett breathed deeply like a man asleep and in less than a minute this lie became the truth and he was dreaming that he was skiing down a panoramic mountain of huge white cliffs rising into an infinitely blue sky halfway to st louis stevie saw his chance he gunned the engine and the car sluggishly responded movmg ahead of a lumbering truck he eased up right behind the yamaha a dirt bike it looked like with the high fenders that doubled as mudguards and the long shocks that would take the potholes and shitty city streets easily the rack was cockeyed stevie studied the yellow fenders and the silver bars and the red helmet and the leather jacket of the driver and then started looking for an exit ramp he saw one a half mile ahead and glanced in the rearview mirror at what loomed behind him it was a white semi not the trailer just the tractor the sort with the ten forward gears and a steering wheel wide as a tire the truck would have air brakes and little weight but at sixty itd skid for a hundred fifty feet a quarter mile away stevie flom started signaling he accelerated until he was three feet from the beer man who was hunched forward sunlight flaring off his helmet the truck driver was holding back seeing stevies turn signal but maybe a little confused because the dodge was not slowing a hundred yards stevie eased into the left side of the lane the truck driver must have figured the signal was a mistake and had accelerated again driving up to within two car lengths of stevie on the right the exit ramp blossomed outward stevie floored the pedal and looked to his right then cut the wheel hard his left front bumper goosed the rear wheel of the yamaha right out from underneath him a mad flurry of motion from the bikea panicked glance over his shoulder as the yamaha began to lie down the horn and the gutsy squeal of the trucks brakes filling the air the mans left boot slamming down onto the highway in an automatic way hopeless reaching up pitching forward flying over the twisted handlebars sparks sailing off the gas tank of the cycle the beer man his mouth open in a shout that stevie could not hear hands outward began to tumble on the concrete at fifty miles an hour the fiberglass of the helmet shredding stevie skidded the dodge into the off ramp just missing a yellow plastic collision barrel as he braked to twentyfive he was too busy controlling the skid to see exactly what happened on the expressway then he was at the bottom of the ramp he heard the squealing of tires and horns then he caught the end of a yellow light and made a leisurely turn onto a grimy cobblestoned street of body shops and empty warehouses and shabby bungalows not far from the mississippi river eighteen the service was in a boxy building in downtown maddox beth israel memorial chapel pellam hadnt known that stile was jewish they had talked about many things from women to whiskey to real estate but religion was in that category of topics where their conversation did not gofor instance why stile remained in his profession and never sought to do secondunit directing as so many stuntmen do or why pellam stopped directing after tommy bernstein died pellam had spoken to stiles cousin in san diego his closest living relativeand he had learned that stile had been raised reform jewish calls were made and a service arranged the body was en route to southern california and people now stood in a dark building in a shabby part of a dark missouri town that had long ago lost whatever allure or novelty it might have had for them from the outfits this seemed more like a fashion show than a service no one had brought funeral clothing of course but this was a hollywood crew so there was plenty of black albeit in the form of minidresses and spandex and baggy suits adding to the surrealness were the yarmulkes perching on the mens heads the stunt coordinator stiles boss was a tough sixtyfiveyearold with blurred tattoos on his forearms now covered by the sleeves of a wrinkled gray suit he had fallen off horses at john fords direction and crashed through windows at sam peckinpahs and he was now crying like an infant a lot of other people cried too nobody had disliked stile the man who fell from foot cliffs and who walked through fire pellam had no idea what to say not to anyone stile had died because of him the yamaha had been the property of the missouri river blues partnership and when pellam had turned over the location forms and files to stile according to sloans orders pellam had added take the yamaha too if you want it tonys gonna make me give it back sooner or later stile thanked him left the rental car at the campground for pellams use and burned rubber away to the interstate he had a date in st louis with hank the lawyer about location releases for the infamous final shootout scene in missouri river blues what could pellam say he put his arm around the shoulders of one of the young actresses and let her cry pellam smelled bitter hair spray and cigarette smoke she wasnt hysterical she trembled pellam didnt cry he went to a pew and sat next to several other crew members older men gaffers a rabbior maybe just the funeral director walked to the front of the room he began talking pellam did not pay attention to the words they were not for him at least important the purpose of the ritual had nothing to do with stile not now it was not the sermon but the interval it occupiedthis hour in a woody mute room with a respectful velvet hat on your headthat was the point a block of time reserved solely for death pellam heard the drone of the speakers words a soft baritone he wished he knew how to pray he decided he would suggest that sloan dedicate missouri river blues to stile a film that had turned out to be not the product of artistic vision at all but simply one hell of a stuntman s movie no not suggest whatever else there was between sloan and him pellam would insist on the dedication it was something he could do but it wasnt enough what stevie flom was going to say first you didnt describe the guy very well second the guy walked out of the camper and got on the cycle third you shouldve done it yourself he got as far as first before ralph bales grabbed his members only black jacket by the lapels and slammed the terrified stevie into the wall of harrys bar gentlemen the bartender wagged a finger but in a lethargic way this was a dingy lysolscented place overlooking one of the less picturesque refineries in wood river illinois it was that sort of bar where the management would let two mentwo white men not too drunk or strungoutgo at it up to a point ralph bales looked from the frightened eyes of stevie flom to the cool eyes of the bartender and let go he had been right on the borderline but now decided not to break his partners nose stevie slumped and ran his fingers through his razorcut hair aw ralph come on ralph bales turned and walked through the bar into the restaurant behind he slid into one of the booths stevie followed him like a buttswatted puppy and sat opposite ralph bales said youre an asshole first what it was he walked out of the camper and got on the yamaha how was i supposed to know thered be somebody else inside you said hed be riding a bike and like anyway you didnt describe him shut up and listen to me lombro is really pissed now it wasnt my fault excuse me i mean excuse me whenre you gonna learn that guys like this dont think about fault whatre you going to say gee mr lombro first i shot a cop and now i killed the wrong man but ive got an excuse did you tell him i did it stevie whispered to ralph baless glee the kid was seriously nervous now he let stevie hangin the wind for some very lengthy seconds i didnt tell him your name thanks ralph that was all right of you i just told him a guy we hired made a mistake we hired like you and me we hired somebody else so he wont think it was me stevie nodded that was good he was pissed but hes not going to do anything about it hes not going the whole nine yards with the bonus because of the screwup but hell give us something if you do it right this time maybe what you could do is describe him better to me maybe what i could do is hold your hand and take you up and introduce you aw ralph come on look this thing is running away from us maybe we should just vanish without a penny i wish youd done the cop right you couldve too stevie said cautiously ralph bales opened his mouth to protest then remembered his gun muzzle nestling in the cops hair i could have too yeah the waitress came by and they ordered boilermakers and hamburgers when she left ralph bales said okay well do the witness this time and do it right stevie said all right sure you still want it to be an accident i mean if thats what you want ralph bales considered this do it however you want i dont care this relieved stevie immensely and he said i just want to say one thing first you didnt describe him very well ralph bales turned on him stevie lifted two palms and grinned joke ralphy joke you got to keep a sense of humor about these things he killed my friend pellam said and im going to get him donnie buffett was not interested in what pellam was going to do penny had called and chanted over the phone to him for five minutes while he stared at the receiver first in disbelief then in disgust he had finally hung up and left the phone off the hook then he had been taken downstairs and poked and probed all morning he had been told to contract his sphincter he had said peevishly my what and the young intern had said your rectum contract it and buffett had said loudly so that patients up and down the hall could hear oh you mean my asshole the rest of the exam had gone like that now here was pellam sweating and wildeyed and talking about getting people look you steal my gun you give me a lecture about things you dont know from then you come in and you start rambling about some killing or another what buffett said evenly do you want from me pellam leaned close buffett blinked at the nearness of his face the pores he could see clearly the way the dark hairs on the top of the mans forehead disappeared smoothly into the skin the look in pellam s eyes reminded him of young cops after their first firefight eager and energized but also quietironically calmed by death and because of that scary extremely scary pellam said the man in the lincoln killed my friend buffett did not respond and pellam told him about stiles death they got us mixed up they saw him leave the camper on the bike and they killed him they thought it was me look pellam its crazy to drive a cycle in the city accidents happen i could tell you the statistics hell with statistics i want you to tell me how to do it do what arrest him can i shoot him if i have to the chanting and the poking and probing faded from the cops mind pellam and his calm scary eyes had buffetts full attention let me make a call he was on the phone for ten minutes as pellam stared out the window pellams lips moved silently from time to time into the phone the cop asked any chance its related to the pellam thing uhhuh yeah well i know how you guys feel but im starting to think hes okay yeah pellam i mean im not so sure he did see the guy in the lincoln pellams head turned buffett said well do what you gotta i understand but take it easy on him it was his buddy got killed when he hung up the cop said theyre calling it an accident hitandrun the truck driver said the car clipped the cycle the tag numbers from a stolen dodge there stolen most hitandruns involve stolen cars thats why theyre hitandruns pellam leaned forward again look i know it was the guy with the mark on his face he mustve seen me go to petersons office after nina was attacked ill have gianno and hagedorn look into it they pellam exploded look into it look into it all they do is hassle me you dont understand im going out that door in five minutes and im going to find the guy who killed my friend and im going to get him if you wont help then the hell with you look pellam if he did it then the guys a pro hes not going to let you just arrest him you by yourself no backup are you crazy are you ready to waste him if you have to you ever shot anybody before buffett shook his head with a condescending smile pellam unzipped his jacket and pulled the colt peacemaker from his belt the grin left the patrolmans mouth and his uneasy eyes followed the gun as it went back into the waistband one thing you might want to remember pellam said quietly the guy with the mark on his face hes probably the partner of the man i saw get out of the lincoln and that makes him the one who shot you no buffett hadnt thought about that but he did now for a long moment he said slowly im a cop i cant help you kill someone i dont care who it is im not going to kill him im going to arrest him buffetts tongue gingerly touched the comer of his lips i dont know what to tell you how do i make a citizens arrest do i have to get him to confess can i just arrest him like in the movies do i have to read him his rights buffett the cop considered well you dont have probable cause the truck driver didnt get a look at the guy driving the dodge the procedure our guysd use is to find a suspect then bring him in and interview him not arrest him just talk to him he doesnt get a lawyer for that but he can get up and walk out any time he wants just talk to him try to find inconsistencies maybe hell mention people whore supposed to be alibis but we can squeeze them and get them to turn its a hell of a lot of work pellam you dont just arrest somebody what if i had a tape recorder with me and got him to say something in it you can tape yourself talking to somebody without a court order thats okay but its a little risky isnt it itll be admissible and everything probably pellam shrugged he walked to the door and stopped what you told them i appreciate it how do you mean what you told the detectives about believing me buffett shrugged pellam noticed him rub his eyes in a resigned way he seemed as tired as the wilting flowers that littered the radiator cover of the room you okay yeah i guess my wife came for a visit he opened his mouth and was suddenly overwhelmed by the volume of things he wanted to say they rushed forward but just before he spoke the torrent dried up instantly and he asked hand me the tv guide would you buffett motioned across the room son of a bitch orderly left it on the dresser what goods it doing me over there i mean some people they just dont think nineteen a knock on the halfopen door woke donnie buffett he was dozing and he awoke from a dream he could not remember but that left a residue of longing yeah he muttered hello the door pushed wider open and a blond womans face appeared her head tilted sideways the face which he did not recognize immediately was delicate and pretty she stepped into the doorway the lope of her walk combined with the delicacy and prettiness made her sexy this in turn depressed buffett even more than pellam s visit hi youre not asleep hearing her voice he remembered her name nina right pellams friend as if she now had permission she entered the room she wore a tightfitting brown silk dress a beige raincoat was over her arm donnie buffett commanded himself to look at neither her abundant breasts nor her sleek pale legs but only at her face youre donnie you just missed him he smoothed his hair and stroked his two days growth of beard with forked fingers did i she grimaced and buffett wondered why he had thought even momentarily that she had come to visit him she asked when did he leave buffett looked at his watch surprised he thought he had slept for hours thirty forty minutes ago thats john hard to pin him down oh hey nice roses the ones i get never open up theres this stuff in a packet that comes with them you put it in the water they smell nice too you dont know where hes gone off to if you only knew lady sure dont no look take some flowers you want the roses take them bu she shook her head he remembered that hed tried this once before nobody liked hospital flowers he figured people thought they were bad luck pellam told me about what happened to you in that factory downtown thats a tough neighborhood you okay she nodded but said nothing as if the memory were too troubling buffett was sorry hed brought up the attack but he felt compelled to add maybe you should i dont know leave town or something until they find who did it i could do that i was thinking i would what she did at the moment though was straighten a disordered pile of magazines on the bedside table until the corners were perfectly aligned buffetts eyes returned to the tv watching sports increased his depression but he had developed a taste for bad afternoon movies provided the sound was off hearing the dialogue spoiled the experience he had fallen asleep watching a silent bad movie about the hijacking of a ship he wanted either to go back to sleep or to watch his movie he was becoming irritated with her i thought visiting hours are over i smiled at the cop outside and he told the nurses to let me in buffett grunted but he tried to make it a pleasant grunt she walked further into the room he did not like her putting her raincoat over the back of the chair this meant she intended to stay she kept looking at him he felt like a freak why wouldnt she leave how are you feeling she asked great im great on the screen the ship hijackers were chasing the good guys around the decks or maybe it was the good guys who were doing the chasing you dont sound real great he looked back at her i get kind of groggy sometimes just sitting here her eyes flicked to his hand youre married right yep your wife visits you everyday sure shes a great little trouper brings me cookies you want a cookie no thank you any lads nope sour cream dip i think its onion i dont remember nina was not going away why was she forcing him to have a conversation with her why was her mouth curled into a tiny little smile when there was nothing to smile about buflett said youve got a relative here right she nodded my mother i was just visiting her i got bored and left is that bad of me she asked this in a pouty way the schoolgirl routine that she seemed to have perfectedand he understood he was supposed to tell her that it was not bad of her which he did though not very sincerely buffett watched the silent machine guns firing at fleeing sailors who called silently for help a number of them got gunned down several were shot in the back well she said no longer smiling youre sure mister quiet commandos were coming to save the ship i guess im watching tv with the sound oft he clicked the off switch hed denied himself the treat of the commandos rescue and now shed sense his resentment and leave but no she was walking around the room in a very leisurely way straightening his magazines then she started on the vases i think im becoming a curmudgeon he said by way of apology what is that exactly got me an old fart i guess she began to throw out the dead flowers id think the nursesd take better care of them theyre pretty busy everybodys busy except me i sit on my ass all day long i can tell you all about fabric softener breakfast cereal and tampons i could learn how to hijack ships if youd leave me the hell alone she washed the vases in the bathroom and left them upside down to dry on the top of the toilet buffett took grudging pleasure in watching her the glass was immaculate some women are good at this he thought give them a dirty bar of ivory and a cheap paper towel and theyd make anything spotless penny had been this way penny is this way he corrected nina walked to a low dresser across the room nothing more to wash no more silent hijackers or monistat commercials no more crazy location scouts no more nothin well im pretty tired buffett said and yawned a fake but large yawn i think id like to get some sleep naw nina said picking up a deck of cards from the dresser dont you think youd really like to play gin rummy john pellam his bomber jacket covering samuel colts deadly brainchild walked with the oblivion of landed gentry through the streets of maddox missouri he kicked at a tuft of tall grass springing from a perfect hole in the middle of a cracked sidewalk slab he continued on there was no traffic here foot or auto along this row of buildings the tallest structure on the blocka threestory factorymay have bustled in its heyday but the building now mocked its past the roof had collapsed long ago and the old green sign on the facade read finery the re ironically worn down by some trick of erosion looking behind him looking down alleys looking more often in the reflections of windows than atthe sidewalk where he planted his brown nokonas pellam saw no one following he turned from this part of town and ambled down thirdpast the spot where donnie buffett had been shot here too he lingered the rains had washed away the blood hed seen if it had been blood and the cobblestones were everywhere clean this is one advantage of ghost townsfewer residents to toss litter on the streets pellam unzipping his jacket slightly paced back and forth he wandered several blocks to the alley through which he had eluded the sedan several days before all deserted tony sloan and the film companystill without their precious machine gunswere filming the few remaining scenes sloan was also pellam guessed spending many hours on the phone arranging for extensions of the financing pellam himself avoided the set sloan wouldnt speak to him besides he had friends there and he wanted to keep what was about to happen as far removed from them as he could he lingered outside the camper at the bideawee he walked slowly around then through the old factory where nina had been attacked he wandered among the gray corrugated metal quonset huts uninhabited it seemed since world war ii he walked along sidewalks of stores selling dusty office supplies and medical supplies he found himself scanning the street in a windows reflection for a long moment and realized he had been staring intently at thick mannequins wearing heavy girdles chastely muted by an amber plastic sunscreen and the store clerk had been studying him with amused curiosity where is he where is stiles killer pellam walked to the river and watched the sunset from a disintegrating bench in the scrubby remains of maddox municipal park the ambitions of the entire town were expressed in a small store behind him the wood sign that proclaimed the owners name was illegibly faded but on the facade itself was a larger message sloppily handpainted scrap metal bought all kinds all grades cash now after a dinner of a hamburger and a beer pellam wandered the streets again streets he shared only with the few people meandering between the jolly rogue and callaghans and with packs of scrawny dogs with wild eyes but hopeful prances that sadly suggested domesticated puppyhoods at midnight he sat again in the park with a beer he did not drink watching the moons stippled reflection in the water smelling the cold marshy air and an oily smell from some distant factory or refinery when is he going to find me yet nothing found him that night but sleep and pellam woke on the bench at am astonished at first at the extent of his exhaustion then at his carelessness and finally at his extraordinary good luck at escaping unharmed he returned to the camper sore and chilled his hands shivering and the only warm aspect about him the wood grip of the colt pressing hard against his belly dr wendy looked good breezy that was the way she walked breezy what did they say in high school there was a word what was it bopping right and you had to snap your fingers when you said it bopping yeah you see that girl you see the way she bopped into the lunchroom yo dr wendy morning donnie he wondered if she sailed he pictured her in a white bikini with thin straps she would have a small mound of a bellyhe remembered the leather nearminiskirtbut that was okay he wondered if she owned a boat no probably not she spent all her money on clothes and weird earrings but her boyfriend might have one he wondered if she spent every sunday on his boat he wondered what it would be like to be married to her he wondered if she ever went out with patients donnie buffett decided he was going to ask her on a date she swung the door shut and did her cigarette routine i wanted to come right by weve got the results donnie the sexual response tests okay im sitting downas if i had an option his smile faded and his brow creased with concern whats the verdict youre reflex incomplete he had forgotten what this meant but the way she said it the significant tone and smile of minor triumph he guessed it was good news nearly one hundred percent of these patients can have erections either reflexogenic or psychogenic not all of them but a good percentage can ejaculate there will be a lowered sperm count but all that means is if you want to have children youll have to try harder weiser shook his hand as if theyd just completed a business deal well there you go buffett said happily and began to sob the cops eyes flooded with tears and his breath shook out of his body in spasms his face swelled with a huge pressure he tried to speak but was unable to whats happening to me weiser said nothing buffett was choking on tears he was drowning in them they were going to kill him drain away his life like spurting blood was he going crazy had it finally happened what stage of recovery is hysteria sweetheart crying harder than when he was a kid harder than when he broke his nose harder than when his mother died he could not breathe he struggled to control the jag finally he did the air sucked in deeply and he relaxed i another attack struck he buried his face in wads of kleenex i he substituted a pillow for the tissue and cried some more gradually the tears ceased can i get you anything weiser asked he shook his head gasping he didnt want her to see him this way the beautiful breezy doctor with the spaghettistrap bikini and the twentyfoot sailboat the doctor with the boyfriend and her twelveyearold daughter but he was out of control gasping for breath and crying like a swatted newborn she asked if he wanted to be by himself and he shook his head and threw his arm over his face after a few minutes he began laughing softly im a nut case he wheezed you dont have any idea the kind of stress youre going through buffett felt no terror and no depression but instead a roaring mania i dont know why im crying i dont know why he whispered as the sobbing began again i dont know why weiser did not offer any explanation she sat for a moment watching him then stood opened the window and lit another cigarette afternoon in maddox missouri pellam had spent hours wandering around again playing bait he walked through antique stores up and down the streets had a beer at each of three interchangeable taverns walked some more looking from behind his raybans for the man who was looking for him as he walked he stayed apart from the crowd he wandered slowly he put his back toward several alleys and many cruising cars pellam decided he had gotten very good at making himself a target at after eight hours on his feet he found himself in the crowded farmers market off river road the dusty parking lot was filled with stalls where farmers traditional ones as well as past and present hippiesfrom missouri and southern illinois sold cheese and veggies and muffins and apples andsure enough northern watermelon pellam looked at the bleak gaiety of the place with its faded banners and a doleful clown tying balloon animals for a small crowd of children with soiled hands and cheeks he heard twangy country western music vibrating out of cheap speakers a half hour later pellam decided it was time to return to the camper he bought a bottle of wine some cheese crunchy dutch pretzels and two plums he clumsily discarded his boots and jacket when he entered the winnebago he washed his face and sat in the back bunk eating the cold supper pellam did not care for apples but the only liquor for sale at the market had been apple wine he bought it reluctantly hoping that alcohol would be more prominent than the apple taste this was somewhat true though it was overwhelmingly sweet he drank half of it down three straight glasses and shivered hard at the sugar hitting his bloodstream he had an urge to see nina but he dared not for fear of imperiling her again this happened so often in his lifewanting then pursuing regardless of the danger oh john pellam did not like this aspect of himself how he welcomed risks this nature had led him to be a stuntman for a time had prodded him to make movies that critics may have loved but that lost big money for many people he easily forgot that others might get hurt because of him john pellam believed in his darker moments that he carried in his heart more of his gunfighting ancestor than was good for him and for those around him he rose poured another glass of wine and carrying the bottle returned to the bunk apple wine disgusting he looked at the label a picture of attractive thirtyish farmers a husband and wife couple hefting a bushel of apples onto a flatbed he decided he detested these particular farmers and their natural nopreservative rosy cheeks he put on a patsy cline tape no too sappy he put on a michael nyman better he noticed a magazine on the floor it had fallen open to the horoscope page he tried to read his and lost interest he lay back onto the bunk taurus april may a bad time for investments career plans may go awry control your temper and dont wander the streets of small cities with a loaded pistol when pellam woke an hour later he couldnt find the wine bottle because of the intense throbbing in his temples he assumed with some remorse that he had finished it but he was wrong the man who stood in the middle of the camper was holding the bottle to his lips taking a long drink his head tilted back as he gulped but his calm eyes studied pellam curiously the man wincedmaybe at the sweetness of the wineand set the bottle down on the table he wiped his mouth with his fingers the same fingers that picked up the colt peacemaker from the dining table and slipped it into his pocket he walked forward toward where pellam lay he was handsome and young and he was wearing a suit pellam was surprised at only one thing at how much the birthmark on his cheek did look exactly like the spot on jupiter he thought of many things to say they came to him quickly some funny some ominous but he was drowsy and he had a serious headache he didnt feel like talking pellam opened his slurred eyes wide to help him focus and continued to stare the visitor touched the rim of the wine bottle and moved his finger in a slow circle around its perimeter outside water lapped on the revetment a truck diesel chugged in the distance neither man said a word pellam swung his feet around to the floor the intruders hand left the bottle and strayed toward his hip where presumably a pistol rested pellam moved slowlynot in fear that he might startle the man but because of the pain in his temples he yawned again the man said you went to peterson when he had yawned pellams eyes watered he wiped the tears away the man said didnt the girl give you the message she told me mr crimmins isnt real happy you went to the prosecutor he hasnt been arrested so he can only assume you kept your mouth shut i dont have anything to say about crimmins he knows you saw him in the lincoln that night what do you want the man was bigsix two or three the clothes fit tight as if he had very good muscles pellam wondered if he had had an erection when he touched nina i want to be sure you forget you saw him oh was that it was he going to leave now just like that make sure you keep telling people you didnt see peter crimmins have a nice night the birthmark man buttoned his jacket and pulled on gloves hes leaving but why the gloves it isnt that cold outside the man stepped forward quickly before pellam could lift his arm to deflect the blow the fist caught him in the side of the head pellam fell backwards and landed heavily in the bunk it had been a glancing strike but on top of an apple wine hangover the pain howled through his head he moaned and shook more tears from his eyes damn pellam gasped whyd you do that he struggled to his feet grasping toward a cabinet to steady himself then his wrist was snared painfully by the mans powerful hand and he was yanked forward into the mans right fist once again it connected with jaw pellam sank down again stunned that girlfriend of yours her face is real pretty the rest of hers probably pretty nice too pellam stood slowly and touched blood away from his cheek he nearly fainted from the pain when the black dots in his eyes settled and his vision returned he leaned against the camper wall for a moment then he made his way unsteadily toward the bathroom he mumbled excuse me as he walked past the man he sounded polite watch it a pistol appeared a dark blue revolver he showed it to pellam in profile opening his hand quickly and then closing the large stillgloved fingers he replaced it pellam leaned against the door to the bathroom he clicked the light on but he did not enter he closed his eyes for a moment leaning against the doorjamb he heard the feet come toward him the familiar morse code of the camper floor creaking under the mans weight he smelled sweet aftershave was this what nina had smelled stile had smelled nothing at all except oil and gas and asphalt and then blood blood blood whatre you doing there the man asked pellam reached into the pocket of the bomber jacket which was hanging next to the bathroom and took from it buffetts pistol the cold gun as he turned pellam said i want you to lie down on the floor instantly the man dropped into a crouch and yanked the pistol off his hip the explosion of the gunshot was huge it rattled the glass windows and spattered the walls with bits of gunpowder cabinet doors shook and from behind a glassfaced poster frame a somber napoleon rocked under the muzzle blast donnie buffett heard the footsteps and opened his eyes a shuffling along the corridor outside his room he had seen doctorslooking somewhat funnyin plastic booties they made the same sort of sound but he doubted what he now heard was made by a doctor he looked groggily at his watch ten oclock did doctors operate at this time of night perhaps it was a nurse the nurses sometimes brought around snacks and although the lights in his room were out and buffett had been dozing if snacks were on the agenda buffett was going to get a snack if this was the case he hoped it was the blond nurse he like her she was gentle and chattered while she did the things she had to do the redhead was silent and seemed to resent her complicated duties with the tubes and bottles and bags but he didnt think it was either of these women donnie buffett husband of a selfproclaimed psychic suddenly had a bad premonition about this visitor he groped for the telephone but before he could grab it the door began to open he couldnt run he couldnt hide but he could fight buffett closed his eyes forced his breath to slip in and out of his lungs leisurely like a man in contented sleep his right hand curled into a fist a fraction of an inch at a time the footsteps came closer buffett tensed the muscles in his arm whoever it was came up slowly on the left side of the bed buffett decided he would grab the guys crotch with his left and when he howled and doubled up go straight for the nose with his right fist he wondered if it was the man who shot him coming back to finish the job if the mo was the same as the gaudia hit hed have a smallcaliber gun a or which doesnt hurt very much and doesnt have any stopping power at all buffett would not die immediately and before he did he could do a lot of damage basketball player softball pitcher jumprope tugger donnie buffett had very strong hands he was suddenly hungry with lust the same feeling that seized his body just before the kill when he was hunting his shoulders started to tremble his arm muscles tensed the footsteps stopped two feet from the bedside donnie the voice whispered he opened his eyes and looked at the shadowy silhouette above him a hand disappeared under the lampshade and the room was suddenly filled with jarring light a whitefaced john pellam sat down in the chair beside the bed hey chief buffett said in an unsteady voice howd you get in here visiting hours are over the back stairs some security you scared the crap out of me ive got to talk to you donnie he stared at buffett no past him his face was pasty the cop wondered if he was sick or if hed fainted pellam held something in his hand something small and dark buffett felt his own hand start to cramp and realized it was still jammed into a large fist he relaxed it and felt the pain subside his heart pounded and he felt a surge of weakness melt through his chest and his abdomen what the hell are you doing here at this hour he too was whispering whats he holding pellam glanced down at his own hand at the object he held he looked back up at buffett and said he broke into the camper the man who attacked nina the one who killed my friend i dont know how he just got in he hit me a couple times he looked at buffett for a long moment i took out your gun the cold gun right jesus i took it out i shot him with it jesus pellam you shot him i wasnt going to i was just going to arrest him he pulled his gun out and hes dead well lets think any witnesses anybody hear anything you think theres more pellam whispered dont panic yet lets think it was a breakin thats burglary and youve got a right to use deadly force even if its a mistake an absolute right okay let me call pellam held up his hand the object was a wallet where were you parked when it happened buffett took the wallet which pellam had thrust toward him absently he turned it over and over theres more pellam blurted once again the cop was still talking about what pellam could do lawyers he knew what sections of the state penal code covered justifiable homicide he opened the wallet he stopped talking after a moment he blinked oh my god pellam asked him i just killed an fbi agent didnt i twenty pellam kept staring at the id buffett said its over the line peterson wouldnt do that its true peterson wouldnt do it he wouldnt dare he was making it look like crimmins was threatening nina and me so id testify against him how else can you explain it buffett shook his head hes the us attorney this was the guy that threatened nina theres no doubt about it impossible she described him perfectly a us attorney is not going to send an agent to assault somebody maybe the guy is working for crimmins or was a rogue agent on the take you know no its peterson hed be crazy peterson i mean too much risk pellam lifted his palm he is crazy you know he tried blackmailing me to get me to testify blackmail pellam took a long moment to hook a thumb through a belt loop i did some time time buffett did not understand san quentin pellam said volunteering nothing more buffett stared for a moment and said nothing pellam continued he was threatening to tell the film company buffett took a breath to speak then he paused finally he said that he just didnt know my friend this guy killed my friend no buffett said emphatically if hes a rogue agent on a private job for peterson murders too over the line petersons on some kind of moral crusade to put crimmins away okay but murder no way maybe it was an accident maybe he was following the bike to scare me he misjudged or something buffett conceded that was possible what did you do with the body pellam thought for a minute as if hed locked away the memory in a hidden part of his mind his car was outside in the alley across the street what did i do i wrapped him up in some garbage bags and put him in the trunk i drove it to the parking lot by the bus station there were a lot of cars there i dont think anybodyll notice it for a while oh i wore gloves you had to do it you didnt have any choice jesus pellam whispered shaking his head numb wheres the gun i put it next to him if anybody found him they might think hed killed himself pellam thats not the way people kill themselves i wasnt thinking too clearly did you wipe off the gun yeah for fingerprints you mean yeah it was a revolver so youll have traces of powder on your hands but you arent going to be picked up in the next twentyfour hours on this when the guy doesnt check in petersonll know somethings wrong assuming he doesdid work for peterson but whats he going to say hell have to deny everything i think youre pretty safe i a nurse entered the room she smiled at donnie she had a tray with a small container of ice cream and two cookies she gave him two pills in a cup snack time she said buffett smiled back what are these he asked the pills sedatives usual he took the pills ativan half a milligram she called him doctor as she said goodnight i always ask they make mistakes sometimes about the pills i mean you ever in the hospital always ask pellam took a kleenex from buffetts dresser and was carefully wiping the agentsid case he said to pellam you want some ice cream uhuh i dont like ice cream you sure buffett opened the ice cream and began to eat it he stopped and set down the spoon pellam you did what i wouldve done yeah buffett picked up the spoon again you know theres something else pellam took a cookie from the tray and ate it the cop continued lets assume youre right and this guy the one you shot was working for peterson uhhuh then the one whos looking for you the one who killed your friend hes still out there i guess he is pellam had not thought about this but what can i do about it dusting off your passport might be a good idea nina on the other end of the phone said id like to see you tonight she sounded seductive pellam was not in the mood to seduce or be seduced he was sitting on a banquette three feet from where the carpet had been stained with an fbi agents blood he had used clorox to scrub it this had worked pretty well but the camper smelled fiercely of bleach i called three times and you never answered i dont have a machine in the camper he said although he did he often did not turn it on theres all kinds of talk around the set about you mr sloans been saying some things that arent real nice hes talking about suing you im real sorry about your friend john i dont remember him but i think i met him once he seemed real nice he was so you want to be alone tonight something like that i dont think its good for you whats not good to be alone come over cranstons only twenty minutes away her voice was a breathy singsong its just not a good time okay if thats what you want melodious became brittle oh not now please are you trying to tell me something she asked brother no no its just this thing with me being the witness and all what about it she asked testily and obviously wanted an answer it seemed patently unfair to have to argue like this with someone you were not sleeping with its taking up a lot of my time its probably not taking up time tonight well it is thereve been some complications complications i thought you were a simple kind of guy she was being playful now perhaps their fight was over i dont know he kept picturing the way the fbi agent fell surprised spiraling down that was it just a fall then he was dead just like that please he heard nina saying she had to see him please john the man had just lain there and pellam had walked into the kitchen and dug under the sink for garbage bags in which to wrap up the body its only twenty minutes he heard himself asking because his brother was a union carpenter and had taken him on dozens of jobs stevie flom appreciated good woodwork he took pleasure in the way joints and studs met and how crown molding fit perfectly in the corners of ceilings tonight he wandered through the dark basement of a ramshackle victorian house by the riverfront and checked out the handiwork not bad not bad at all though he wondered why anybody would renovate a house here where the only views were of a cement plant a trailer camp on its last legs and pelican island stevie looked at the structural work again he approved of the wooden studs instead of the metal ones most builders used that meant the wall was going to be nice and solid he looked at the wiring electricity was one thing he wanted to learn about he was good with hydraulics and mechanics but the idea of electricity was land of weird the concrete floor he observed was not in good shape a lot of cracks and places where it had crumbled he saw evidence of standing water that was one thing his brother had told him to look for in basements evidence of standing water stevie wished he had something to read he thought of his old man who kept newspapers and time magazines piled up n the basement at homestacks and stackswith a few playboys hidden between them their places marked with twigs but herenothing but the boiler instructions encased in plastic his brother had once returned with three hundred bucks he had found in an old book while doing some work in alton this place was nothing but old basement with evidence of water damage he was dying for a cigarette but he knew he shouldnt smoke the ash would be evidence he had seen that on magnum pi one time evidence of a killer or was it a matlock rerun so he just walked to a half window and gazed outside across the street to the empty trailer court wondering when the hell was the beer guys winnebago going to return he put his head against ninas hair and inhaled he liked the smell animalmusky and sweaty and perfumed he breathed in again and woke her up hm she asked go to sleep pellam whispered i was asleep go back to sleep hm regardless of pellams mood and inclination several hours ago a seduction it had been cranston just off the expressway was a town much smaller than maddox and more affluent and gingerbready a riverfront tourist trap the town was filled with shops selling antiques and gadgets and cute things nina apparently did much shopping there her apartment was filled with gingham pillows needlepoints of children holding hands plaques of geese dressed in colonial garb wooden hearts and stuffed animals and silk flowers pellam hated it all he had hoped the bedroom might be less cute but of course it was just the same worse in fact because ninas hobby was photography no not even snapshooting the bedroom contained her collection of photosfifty sixty a hundred of them all in precious little lucite and pewter and china frames lining the radiator cover and windowsill and bedside table pellam was afraid to turn aroundabruptly they made love under the eyes of ninas extended family and during one particularly energetic moment a round frame fell to the floor bounced several times and rolled for a long time in an exorbitantly distracting way oh yes a seduction but an odd one she had greeted him at the door wearing a white tshirt and short tight dark gray skirt sans stockings barefoot she reminded him of lynn redgrave in georgy girl they had ordered out hunan beef and cold noodles in sesame paste and eaten while they watched a bad tv show nina had loved it a murder mystery pellam watched her lips moving as she whispered to herself reciting the clues and trying to figure out who the killer was he sat closer and put his arm around her she rubbed her head against his as she announced that the victims brotherinlaw had done it she had been wrong then instantly she was tired of mass media just as the midnight movie came on nina turned off the tv hiked her skirt up and sat on his lap he got an unabashed view of sensible white panties and she began kissing him her arms lashed around his shoulders and in a frenzy she pressed her mouth to his shoving her tongue into him rocking her hips desperately he tasted chinese food as much as he tasted nina and because he was so startled by the assault it took a minute or two to pick up the pace the thing is she whispered i have something to say he responded by taking off her tshirt her bra was shimmery and silver and very transparent and it halfheartedly supported large breasts that she kept playing against his chest what he whispered she kissed him its important her breasts battered him again and he bent toward one listen to me she whispered insistently but it was a breathless insistence and he did not instead he kissed her for a full minute no i mean it she slapped the back of his hand as it probed pellam lifted his head startled they lay halfreclining halfnaked pressed against each other he gave her his attention but she did not speak immediately he reflected that there is nothing more ridiculous than two people in the posture of lovemaking when they are not making love i dont want you to stay over she said pellam was looking for hooks and eyelets thiss what you want to tell me just explain it to me as you go along im ovulating she said as if it were a trade secret ill be careful she blinked and pressed her mouth to his for a long moment when they could both breathe again she said well of course you have to use a condom but what im saying is dont make too much out of this im not really in control its just hormones i dont care what it is he meant this sincerely his hand danced along sparkles of the mesh bra she leaned away and pressed a finger to his lips you have to promise me you wont stay tonight he whispered youre beautiful shhhh she frowned just promise what was the question okay sure but youre still beautiful no im not can i stay for a few minutes at least she kissed him again just not all night she rubbed against him she smiled girlishly and he believed whatever had so enigmatically interrupted the moment was past now an hour later lying in the huge bed huge to him he was used to winnebago bunks smelling the animal scent of her scalp pellam felt better there were times when there ought to be nothing but this being as close as you can to another human being overlapping skin mixed sweat lying in silence and scents he found himself aroused again his hand slid down her belly and touched the curled pale hair that reminded him of the fine hairs at her temple she swatted his hand againthis time with more energy than he thought necessary are you all right pellam had whispered this same question at other moments like this the query did not have its literal meaning of course but was intended as an emergency exit that allowed other wordswhatever she wanted or needed to sayto escape nina whispered i have to tell you something hormones pellam said to be light about it its all right i understand he kissed her hair she moved away from him you want me to leave he asked already offended well yes i do not this minute though youre beautiful he said trying to recapture some romance stop saying that the curtness in her voice seemed not so much irritation as distraction as if she was considering how to express a complicated thought and was running through variations before she spoke when she did speak finally sitting up and pulling the sheet around her the message was not as tricky as he had anticipated she said your friend donnie the cop i just wanted you to know that i slept with him the other night when stevie flom heard the sticky sound of the campers slowing tires on damp asphalt he stood up fast and notched the back of his hand on a bolt damn he whispered and sucked the small wound he tasted blood and rust and he wondered if he ought to get a tetanus shot but then he figured that if the cops looked around this building after they found the body they might see some blood on the bolt and search all the hospitals for people whod gotten shots he was proud that hed thought of this for the third time that night he checked the beretta he pulled the slide back slightly there was one round in the chamber and the clip was full they were small bullets just longs not even the fullsize long rifles but they had advantages for one thing you needed no silencer another advantagethe gun was so small and the recoil so slight that you could group rapidfire shots real close tricks of the trade stevie watched the winnebago rock to a stop in the trailer park the man stepped outside and hooked up the hose and plugged a large electrical cord into a junction box he returned to the camper stevie then made his way out of the structurally sound basement that contained evidence of water damage he cocked the gun and slipped the safety off he started across river road twentyone he was thinking he had done it wrong forget what she had said and what she had not pellam should have stayed this was one of those rules about relationships that no one ever teaches you sometimes you were supposed to leave and sometimes you were supposed to stay and you had to read a lot of data fast to figure out which now locking the camper door pellam debated the matter with himself it was complicated because he doubted he or any man would have done what she did a confession like that at some time sure well maybe but lying in a bed with three scratch marks from her pink nails on his biceps never we played cards for a couple of hours she had explained i wasnt supposed to be there it was after visiting hours i sat on his bed hes very sensitive you wouldnt think he would be being a cop but he is his hands were the giveaway theyre very soft spare me no details his wifes a fruitcake and hes been very depressed he said people are afraid to come see him because he cant walk theyre afraid of him i think hes a very funny man is pellam had agreed one thing led to another finally he started to cry im a sucker for men who cry he said he didnt think hed be able to you know perform anymore its the one thing thats eating him up even more than not walking i asked him if i could hold him and i sat on the bed and i guess she had shrugged her shoulders and the beautiful breasts that had been pulled and prodded by two men in as many days slipped out from under the sheet she covered herself again and he was able to uhn perform pellam had asked he shouldnt have he had forgotten he was talking to the queen of detail oh yeah she had said enthusiastically twice we were both pretty surprised twice pellam thought but you slapped my hand when i wanted to do it twice this however would have sounded very juvenile and he had contented himself with picking up his clothes with dramatic swipes i better be going dont hate me john im sorry she had started to cry i dont hate you i just saw him lying there so sad you did a good thing for him i know how depressed hes been pellam had spoken with reassurance and in a kind voice on the other hand he was dressed in three minutes and out the door in five now he now reflected shouldve left glad did pulling his shirt off as he walked into the winnebagos tiny bathroom smelling her perfume on the cloth he turned the shower water on the hookup was not very good the pressure was low and the water was full of minerals which meant that the soap would not lather it scummed he stepped into the bedroom area dropped his change and bills and wallet and keys on the bed in one big messy pile he thought how much he liked living alone he pulled off his pants and stepped into the shower stevie flom decided he couldnt shoot a man who was naked so he sat sideways in the drivers seat of the camper and looked at the worn controls he listened to the electricmotor sound of the water he licked his gouged hand he was suddenly very tired and decided he needed a vacation from ralph bales from lombro from this pissant river town what stevie was going to do was take his money from this job and spend two months in las vegas maybe while he was there he would check around for local work he liked the idea of perpetual sun he liked the idea of glossy casinos open twentyfour hours a day free drinks and soft flesh and many hours away from the wife he thought it was funny killing someone whose name you didnt know he looked around the dash and found an id card for a movie set he learned that the beer mans name was john pellam pellam pettam he repeated to himself the water stopped hissing footsteps the camper creaked the door opened he smelled shampoo stevie lifted the gun pellam wearing a thick brown bathrobe and socks stepped into the hall he blinked howd you get in here who are you stevie flom smiled coldly and he felt a sudden jolt of nausea a burn spreading through his gut his hands started to shake his teeth bared by the mad smile were rattling he pushed the gun closer toward pellam who was speaking though stevie couldnt hear the words he didnt know whether the guy was yelling in anger or begging not to be killed stevie simply checked out to anxiety and his whole body started sweating he pulled his right elbow in close to his body to stop the trembling no effect his head shook his neck he tilted his head sideways as if that would let the nervousness run off him onto the floor but he kept shaking trying to calm himself he ordered pellam to sit but the man just stood there looking at him angrily ignoring sit down stevie growled the words were lost in a nervous swallow pellam remained standing his eyes began to scan the room stevie heard some words my friend you were the one the motorcycle stevie took the gun in his left hand and wiped the palm of his right on his pants then gripped the pistol again pellam took two steps sideways and picked up an empty wine bottle like a club okay pellam said okay what does he mean by okay hes got a bottle ive got a gun what the hell does he mean by okay stevie told himself to hold the gun out then he realized he was already doing so he stepped closer to pellam what the hell does he mean by okay stevie stepped back again squeeze nothing happened his finger would not respond he looked at his hand this did not help squeeze the fucking trigger he realized he had mouthed the words maybe he had actually said them pellam was saying put it down stevies mind suddenly went blank he stuck the gun out in a single furious motion pointed it right at pellams chest closed his eyes and began to pull the trigger the cloud of glass surrounded stevie flom bluish smoke and a thousand splinters from what had been the window of the camper enveloped him the explosion seemed to occur a moment later as the dust of shattered glass settled on the floor stevie flom turned toward the window his muscles now relaxed the trembling gone he turned toward the window and said its all right itll be fine really then he dropped to the floor the door of the camper swung open and a man stepped inside filling the room with his huge bulk wearing a sport coat and jeans moving fast on small feet he ignored pellam who stepped back out of his way what the hell was going on shutting out lights who are quiet the man barked sure pellam said bright light angled in from the kitchen and gave the room a tilted appearance like a fun house the man shut this light out too he went to the window and looked out in the darkness pellam said are you a cop shhh he walked to stevie flom and felt his neck pocketed his little gun then walked to the opposite window of the camper and looked out once more for a long moment he turned and looked at pellams hand which held the apple wine bottle by the neck you got that for any reason his voice was thick but accentless no uhuh pellam put the bottle down you pellam he nodded and asked who are you tom stettle i work for a mr crimmins he crimmins peter crimmins pellam looked at stevie he works for crimmins uhn no sir that he doesnt stettle said matteroffactly mr crimmins hired me to keep an eye on you oh pellam stared at the body whos he stettle did not answer but bent down and started emptying stevies pockets he was going to loll you whats exactly going on without looking up from his task stettle said mr crimmins knows that you didnt see him in that car the night vince gaudia got killed he didnt have nothing to do with the hit he wants to make sure you stay alive to tell everybody that so hes had me looking out for you youre a tough man to stay on top of let me say stevie flom didnt seem to be bleeding was he really dead this he asked stettle who seemed surprised at the question well sure he is help me huh lets get the body into my car i just happened to check by tonight it was like lucky i didnt figure he was here already i figured theyd do you on the street like they did gaudia hes the one who shot the cop i dunno probably stettle said you have any garbage bags beg your pardon garbage bags thick ones if youve got them ive got some sure pellam went into the kitchen and drank a full glass of water he found stettle standing in the doorway looking at him you want some sure pellam poured another glass and held it out stettle took it in a huge hand pellam asked him did you see the other guy out there what other guy there are two of them pellam motioned to stevie flom hes not the one i saw get out of the lincoln he isnt stettle drank the water you mean theres somebody else yeah heavy guy balding stettle grimaced ill do what i can to keep an eye out for you but i cant be your roommate after this he nodded at stevie s body whoever was in the car is going to be after you in a big way you should take a vacation take a year off or so thats what people keep telling me stettle was eager to leave he finished the water and took a paper towel then wiped the glass off with this same towel he wiped everything else in the camper he had touched you got to get a new window he said and broke out the rest of it with his elbow pellam assumed he didnt want to leave an obvious bullet hole pellam stared as the bits of glass flew outward i guess i should say thanks i mean stettle was uninterested in gratitude he soaked the paper towel that held a dozen of his fingerprints and wadded it up slipped it into his pocket garbage bags he asked sure pellam handed him some rubber gloves gloves playtex you know pellam found two old pairs stettle and he put them on the blood nowadays you cant be too careful you know and for the second time in two days john pellam was wrapping a body in green glad bags three mils thick she pulls off the brown dress this scares him seeing the arc of the dress falling onto the chair he smells fruity perfume she is undoing pins from her wispy hair which tumbles down her neck the hair is like white light it ends just above her substantial bra she smooths her hands along it from her neck over her breasts down to her waist she tosses her head her hair terrifies donnie buffett not saying a word she leans forward and lets the hair stream over his arm and face his eyes are locked on to her hair terrified but unable to look away his hand closes on it he rubs it between his fingers he weighs a huge handful no dont do this to me please dont she looks down at him at the terror on his face i want to go to sleep i want to but she is bending forward a slight smile on her face he is enveloped in her perfume strawberry and spice and she is kissing him her mouth firm against his he feels her tongue just its tip against his lips then through them she is kissing him hungrily he is trembling she backs away she is wearing a large silver sparkly bra garter belt and stockings and white panties all white all lacy and glistening in the low light look donnie buffett says and he is sweating dont shhhh she bends forward and kisses him again he feels the pressure of her breasts under the silky cloth she knows he feels it and rubs against him as she kisses him her tongue slips farther into his mouth he doesnt know what to do he kisses her back wondering if hell feel anything if hell feel that twistywarm sense but then no he doesnt and then he wants her to go away wanting that more than hes ever wanted anything in his life she backs off again still smiling he is terrified and begs her to leave the thing is with this accident like i was saying you she turns her back to him ignoring him he hears her whisper help me his arms slump im sorry please she whispers for me i want it for me somehow this changes everything he lifts his hands and undoes the hook of her bra and she is backing intohim forcing his hands to encircle her breasts and grip them her neck is inches from his mouth he lowers his mouth to it and is caught in an avalanche of her hair he tastes it he smells strawberry when she rubs against him it is as though they are underwater and their bodies are sliding past each other on the current he turns her around in his arms and kisses her hard she slides off the bed and stands in front of him as she slips her panties down he sees the blond fuzz this hair too fascinates him it is so fine you cant really see the hair its more a blur of focus where her legs come together she begins to touch herself running her hands over her body taking handfuls of her head hair and spreading them around her flesh then she hops up on the bed again puts one leg on either side of his head and bends forward kissing his chest and stomach as she pushes the blankets aside he is muttering no no no but the way it is working out his mouth being where it is she cant hear his words anyway and he gives up talking and all he can do is think hell lets do it do it do it thisa memory not a fantasywas prominently in donnie buffetts mind when he opened his eyes and saw john pellam standing in the doorway of his hospital room buffett blinked then he cleared his throat hey chief i wasnt expecting you hello donnie pellam walked into the room his boots made a particularly loud noise oh christ he knows listen john buffett looked up at the blank tv screen then at the row of flowers his face felt suddenly thick and hot as if filled with steam oh man heres the guy bought me beer and has treated me like a real person hes the first one in the whole world after the accident to tell me to go to hell no kid gloves no bullshit and what do i do i fuck his woman oh man oh man john listen i was going to tell you pellam was grinning this made buffett feel a thousand times worse it wasnt like i planned it i know i was ragging you about the casting couch thing but its not like i said to her oh poor me i cant get it up it wasnt a trick or anything that didwork though come to think of it its all right donnie im not saying she came on to me id never say that to avoid taking my own lumps you know but she was easy to talk to and i was feeling really bad she hugged me and it just sort of happened i really was going to tell you really man but last time you were in you were so you know upset about your friend she isnt for me pellam told him no no she likes you i know she does wait would this make him feel better or worse what happened donnie ive got no claim on her i talked you up afterwards he said this cautiously pellam was sitting down in the chair i wouldntve come by today if i was mad buffett could think of nothing to do but extend his hand they shook solemnly and pellam seemed amused by this formal gesture of apology i need some help donnie anything you name it my buddies still hassling you ill get them off your case john dont worry ill call the mayor if i have to pellam looked over the untouched dinner tray donnie followed his eyes he asked break bread havent eaten in a day help yourself it wasnt bread it was soup rice and red jello pellam ate the soup buffett the rice they split the saltines and divided the jello into two bowls you know dont you buffett said jello really sucks uhhuh but pellam seemed hungry and with milk poured over it the jello was not bad though pellam didnt get much milk he had the fork and buffett had the spoon one cube slipped away from buffett and he chased it off the tray and onto the sheet and blanket shit he cocked his middle finger against his thumb and flicked the cube into the wall it left a pink wound on the wall and splatted on the floor the men laughed pellam told buffett about an old record of his uncles a comedy record from the fifties who was the guy del close he thought it was called how to speak hip there was this routine he explained about a man who gets hung up on jello he keeps eating these bowls of jello and ordering more going from restaurant to restaurant everybodys staring at him what flavor was it strawberry he thought or raspberry its to teach you the expression hung up on you know like beat talk was a foreign language pellam said that he had listened to the record a hundred times when he was a kid he loved the jello routine buffett smiled politely waiting for the punch line but apparently there was none you have to sort of hear it pellam said and be in the mood no it was funny buffett said quickly today at least he was pellams toady but pellam seemed to have lost his taste for humoras well as for jello and for conversation he wiped his face he nodded to the bedside table and said i guess i better do it let me see that phone for a minute would you the us attorney was in court when the call came in the secretary buzzed nelsons office and asked theres a man on three he says its important when will mr peterson be back take a message darling nelson snapped he returned to a lengthy set of interrogatories its a mr pellam and he says click mr pellam mr pellam how are you this is mr petersons assistant nelson stroud is there something i can do for you i want to talk to peterson is this about the crimmins situation pellam said that it was well is there anything i can help you with where is he mr peterson hes in court he wont be back for several hours oh there was a long silence nelson gripped the phone hard and believed that if he breathed too loud he would blow away the fragile phone connection youre a lawyer assistant us attorney for the okay i want a meeting bingo fine absolutely fine you name a time you name a place whatever your office id like it to be in your office sure thats fine tomorrow tomorrow morning sure tomorrow morning only what is it only theres a problem i need some assurance from you assurance assurance of course nelsons hands were vibrating this was the big time this was negotiating with vital witnesses and he was terrified what exactly do you have in mind i want some guarantee that i wont be prosecuted pellam said why would you be prosecuted there was a pause because i lied when i told you i hadnt seen peter crimmins in the lincoln twentytwo the press conference that evening was short the reporters had hoped for something hotperhaps petersons announcement that he was resigning to run for the senate or that he was handling some big corporate whistleblower case or that the justice department would dish up something photogenic for the newshoundslike a good drug bust the sort where the fbi and dea lay out all the uzis and brownings in the front of the table and all the plastic bags of smack or coke in the back and declaim about the progress in the war on organized crime but all they got was peterson standing at a chipped podium emblazoned with a us department of justice seal droning on and on and on he spoke to them in the vast monotone that marked his delivery at all of his press conferences im pleased to announce that a witness in the vincent gaudia killing has come forward and agreed to testify before the grand jury this is an individual whom my office identified immediately after the killing and who had serious and understandable concerns about his safety and who expressed those concerns but who has now come forward in exchange for my agreeing not to prosecute for obstruction of justice which was a jawcracker of a sentence and left the reporters thinking up fast paraphrases when asked if this was a reliable witness peterson said he looked into the front seat of the car driven by the man we are certain is responsible for the killing he was no more than three feet away he assures me he can make a positive id a reporter shouted has peter crimmins been identified as the man in that car but peterson knew the game of reporter dodge he was not going to give the defense lawyers a chance to claim prejudice he said all i can say at this time is that the witness will be giving us a formal statement at ninethirty tomorrow morning we anticipate an arrest within twentyfour hours of that peterson then deflected a number of questions about the killing and talked about several drug busts and other recent prosecution victories of the us attorneys office recently i heard rumors a woman reporter called in an abrasive voice that you arrested tony sloan the movie director whos currently shooting a film in maddox peterson glared into the video camera lights that is absolutely untrue the movie company brought a large number of automatic weapons into the district both fbi and batf agents from the treasury department observed what appeared to be an irregularity in the firearm permits and we just wanted to keep an eye on them to make sure they didnt fall into the wrong hands we did not at any time contemplate criminal action against mr sloan and the film company the local police in maddox i understand took it upon themselves for some reason to make an arrest our findings are that the permits are in order and im releasing the weapons presently are you saying that the maddox police arrested mr sloan improperly i wont comment on the judgment of fellow law enforcement agencies the arrest was a maddox police department decision ask them about it there were several other no comments finally a very preoccupied ronald peterson wandered off the stage leaving the press corps to call their desks or tape their intros most of the tv reporters were far more interested in the tony sloan angle than the gaudia killing and decided to run some clips from circuit man in the segment about sloans arrest but hard news is hard news and everybody wrote up at least a news bite about the witness for ten oclock vince gaudia was after all maddoxs only honesttogod hit for as long as anyone could remember as it turned out ralph bale was playing darts and did not happen to hear the story philip lombro however did and by nine that evening was on the phone he cheated us lombro said he took the money and he cheated us hes going to testify his voice was high some of this was indignation and some of it was anger but most of his agitation came from disgust with himself that this whole thing had gotten wildly out of hand looks that way ralph bales said hes meeting peterson tomorrow at ninethirty after a lengthy silence in which he heard the sound of male laughter in the background lombro said what exactly are you going to do okay i think youve gotta agree we dont have much choice lombro sighed deeply he did not agree with anything that ralph bales said or thought but the whole matter had moved beyond him now he realized he was being asked a question and said what i said you havent by any chance heard from a guy named stevie flom have you who a guy working with me no i dont even know him why would i no reason i havent heard from him why would he call me i mentioned i worked for you once its not important anyway about our situation just finish this thing lombro said desperately finish it you want me to do what you have to were lombros closing words but they had hardly the energy to carry forty miles to the other end of the phone line the hour was not late it was not his normal bedtime but philip lombro hoping that tomorrow would appear and then vanish with invisible speed took two sleeping pills and in his silk pajamas slipped into his bed he lay awake for a long time tormented by thoughts of what he had done thoughts about the witnesss betrayal thoughts about how he was soon going to have another mans blood on his hands but under the sedation of the valium he calmed and eventually the man who was going to die tomorrow did not occupy his thoughts nor did vincent gaudia nor ralph bales philip lombro was in that netherworld between sleep and waking bits of dreams floated past like the papers caught in the fickle currents around the maddox omnibus building he saw faces most of them grotesque melting into other shapes they were real to him intense threedimensional they reminded him of the images seen through those plastic threedimensional viewers he used to buy his nieces and nephews thirty years ago the ones that held cardboard disks of fairy tales and cartoons one of these faces though was not grotesque it was a girls face a young girls she was beautiful her features did not melt her eyes simply looked toward him lombro was powerless to touch her or speak he was merely observing you dont participate in dreams like this then the girls face suddenly grew so terribly sad that lombro became completely awake pierced by an urge to cry and he sat up abruptly this was the hardest part of living alone philip lombro knew waking from dreams by yourself pellam was up at seventhirty he had slept in a location vanone of the big winnebagos used for makeup he rose silently and walked into the bathroom where he took a tepidwater shower then he brushed his teeth with his fingers and a spoonful of arm hammer he felt groggy and hoped he would find something energizing in the medicine cabinetdiet pills nodoz but there was nothing other than a prescription drug he had never heard of the label warned against operating machinery or driving a car while taking the medicine it would be coffee or nothing pellam dressed in the bathroom the cloth of his shirt and jeans darkened by the water he had failed to towel off he brushed his damp hair and forwent the noisy blow dryer he was here as a spy or at best refugee and wanted his presence kept secret slipping outside he hurried down the front steps and shivered in the cool fall air there was a rich loamy scent of water which he knew would be the river though he could not see it from here at the curb he paused to let pass a powder blue car slowing as it passed the trailer on the side was a sign out of work days the number was on a separate piece of cardboard freshly taped over the previous days record i do odd jobs the man called but he drove on before pellam could say a word ralph bales found his heart was beating like the wings of a panicked sparrow he looked at his wrists focusing on the veins surprised that they were not vibrating with blood his hands returned to the steering wheel ralph bales was waiting downtownin a stolen chevyoutside the federal building on mission waiting for john pellam to arrive and the reason his heart was beating so fast was that this was a terrible site for a hit on the way here he had passed a car wash whose name was world o wash the phrase kept going through his mind and all he could think of was world o cops fbi treasury agents federal marshals and city cops and probably missouri bureau of investigation agents all over the placethem plus court security guards who had never fired a piece except to get their tickets and had been waiting for years to draw first blood in the line of duty world o cops inside the entryway of the building were two whiteshirted guards big men with large square heads crowned with fade cuts secretaries and clerks and lawyers in running shoes over their dress socks or stockings were streaming into the office everyone looked young and eager there were several entrances to the federal building but ralph bales was parked in front of what seemed to be the main one he supposed there would be a service door or two he could see a driveway that seemed reserved for garbage pickups that would be a good place to sneak a witness in but he had no partner stevie still had not shownand all he could do was cover the main entrance he had arrived early thinking the beer man would get here well before nine thirty for security reasons for an hour ralph bales sat in the car the engine running he moved it only once when a meter maid waddled by she held her citation book out like a gun threateningly he did not let her get close enough to see his face he pulled away slowly did an aroundtheblock and by the time he got backmaybe three minutes latershe was gone he parked again in front of the building it was now ninefifty he watched the mist in the air the sunlight flashing off the tall arch he smelled the burnt metallic air laced with exhaust the factories on the east side of the mississippi were busy this morning his heart fluttering maybe it was the caffeine in the coffee he glanced down he had left the cup in the car the cardboard carton blue and white with pictures of greek gods or olympic athletes or something a cup with his fingerprints all over it careless he reached down and picked it up crumpling the cardboard and slipping it into his pocket it was then that the trash basketone of those big filthy orange thingswent through his back window jesus mother holy not exactly through the window even cheap american cars had strong glass the bottom rim of the basket pushed the window in a couple inches and the glass turned opaque with frost from the fractures the basket rolled off the car and onto the street son of a when he turned back to pull the door handle up there was a gun muzzle in his face and the mans other hand was shutting the engine off he understood ralph bales knew exactly what had happened put your gun in the back the beer man said on the floor ralph bales said i dont have a the mans voice terrified him with its serenity put your gun on the back floor of the car okay whatever you want put your i heard you ralph bales said im going to do it now okay this reminded ralph bales of when the cop caught him just after the gaudia hit only today thered be no stevie flom acting like a madman and stepping out of an alleyway to save him with a sudden sickening feeling he had a good idea about what had happened to stevie flom he dropped the colt in the back the man opened the back door and scooped it up he sat in the backseat and pressed the muzzle of his gun an old one against his ear turn all your pockets inside out what if the meter maid shows up now christ this guy could panic and shoot them both i dont have anything i mean like a weapon or all your pockets ralph bales did dropping the contents on the seat the beer man prodded the money and the wallet and the crumpled cup and the swiss army knife okay put it back in your pockets except the knife leave the knife ralph bales laughed the knife youre kidding he was not kidding ralph bales did what he was told the man put his seat belt on drive to maddox now but drive bales reached for the shoulder strap no belt he rested the gun against the back of ralph bales s neck this is a singleaction gun you know what that means you have to cock it before you can pull the trigger ralph bales said like a student answering a teachers question i have it cocked it goes off real easy okay listen if we hit a bump then id drive real slow if i were you the dream was wonderful she was beautiful nina sassower believed that although men came on to herand did so quite frequentlythey did so only because of the size of her breasts and her thin legs she believed they tolerated her face which she saw as pointed and narrow and pinched but in the dream something had happened perhaps she had had an operation maybe she had just been mistaken all her life she did not know what had changed but the person she was in the dream was tall and willowy and had sharp intelligent beautiful eyes the image didnt last long it shifted into something else a street she couldnt identify then other people began milling around and the dream ended she woke up for perhaps two seconds she felt the afterglow of the dream she sat up straight looked at the clock and spat out oh no son of a bitch it was nine oclock she pulled off her nightgown and yanked open the drawer to her dresser panties brano bra she couldnt find one she kept looking forget it she slipped a sweater on thinking that it was the first time since the age of thirteen that she had left the house without a bra slacks anklet stockings they dont match wheres the mate where hell with it go beige pumps go go go nina pulled on her blue jean jacket she hadnt washed her face and she felt a rim of sweat on her forehead she paused in the mirror to brush her hair and she did that only because she didnt want to look conspicuous for what she was about to do conspicuous would not be good she left the house and hurried to her car after she started the engine she looked into her purse to make certain that it contained what she had put there the night before a militaryissue semiautomatic pistol the classic colt sat heavily between an estee lauder compact and a pink plastic tampax container nina knew the gun about as well as she knew her singer sewing machine although she could not fieldstrip it blindfolded she could dismantle it sufficiently to clean and oil the bore and the parts and did so every time she fired it this gun happened to be identical to the ones rosss gangsters carried in missouri river blues although ninas was loaded with ten rounds of live ammunition and was not registered with the federal government or with anybody else nina now started the cars engine and not even slowing at a single stop sign or red light sped through the quaint quiet burg of cranston missouri then skidded onto the expressway hurrying south toward where she believed john pellam would be twentythree being a lawyer he was used to rewriting ronald peterson never signed off on a letter interrogatory complaint motion or brief without hours of revision but the twopage press release describing peter crimmins s indictment for the murder of vince gaudia had taken more time per word than anything that peterson had written in years he had just learned however that this was one press release that was not going to be released to anyone he changed his mind peterson whispered barely controlling his fury thats what the message said nelson explained cautiously looking away from his bosss enraged eyes and theres no answer at his phone the phone in his camper i sent an agent to maddox the campers not in the trailer park somebody in one of the vans said pellamd been fired and they dont know where he is think crimmins got him well according to the receptionist he didnt sound coerced why the fuck didnt she put through the call shes fired shes out of here nelson said delicately he didnt want to speak to you he wanted to just leave a message what exactly did it say again just that hed changed his mind that was it peterson clicked a fingernail and thumbnail together seven times any hint from the taps on crimmins nothing useful business as usual we can take that one of two ways either hes using a safe phone to talk to his muscle or he heard the press conference and for some reason hes not concerned about the guy testifying why wouldnt he be concerned one reason he wasnt the man in the lincoln after all why nelson pondered would pellam be jerking our leash like this peterson had told no one about the freelance fbi agent who had gone after pellams girlfriend and then pellam himself to help pellam remember about crimmins and vanished shortly afterward nor did nelson know that there was nothing whatsoever wrong with tony sloans federal firearm notices nelson therefore didnt know that pellam had some very good motives for jerking leashes cold feet i suspect the us attorney suggested what about the first option that crimmins got to him peterson shook his head even crimmins wouldnt be that stupid hell the pressll play it like weve got hairy palms what do you want to do nelson gazed down at the press release whats your assessment of the case against crimmins without pellams testimony im speaking of the gaudia hit nelson thought for a minute peterson made a cats cradle with a rubber band and studied his protege whose squinting eyes and pursed lips only partially revealed the lavish anxiety he felt id say probable cause if we want to arrest him but we wont get an indictment nelson cleared his throat and the original indictment the rico charges without gaudias testimony he said acquittal sixtyforty nelsons grimace was the equivalent of hunkering down in a bunker before a bomb detonated but petersons sole reaction was to press his teeth together his breath hissed out from between them and then he chewed on his tongue in rapt contemplation he slowly concluded that there was as much danger for him in the crimmins case as there was potential to score one for the good guys it was time for the whole thing to go away he told this to nelson and added call crimminss lawyer see if we can plead him away for a few years nelson quickly responded will do and noted coolly that this order was tantamount to scuttling two years of work what about pellam theres still somebody out there looking to hurt him should we get bracken or monroe on it i mean the guy could be in trouble peterson wound up a toy donald duck which walked for ten inches hit an indictment then marched in place until the spring wound down its pellams problem now hes on his own she drove quickly racing along main street in maddox past the empty storefronts the darkened real estate brokerages the goodwill store the car spun up a wake of bleached dull leaves nina had driven from cranston to the federal building in st louis she hadnt been able to find pellam though his camper had been parked in a lot across the street it had been empty where she wondered had he gone she paced in panic up and down the sidewalk she suddenly believed she knew she had leapt into the car and sped back to maddox now driving along deserted main street she was not so sure she had guessed correctly the emptiness seemed to laugh at her where the hell is he as she skidded around a curve beside abandoned grain elevators images jumbled in her mind pellam standing in the field beside the brown missouri aiming his polaroid nina herself applying makeup to a petite blond actress wearing a yellow sundress riddled with bullet holes pellam lying in bed next to nina herself the huge kick of the colt automatic that jarred her arm from wrist to shoulder every time she fired it you know something ralph bales asked the question in a normal volume though it echoed loudly through the empty factory he looked around quickly startled by the sound of his own words returning the beer man did not apparently want to know anything ralph bales continued i dont even know your name introductions were not however made the man prodded him farther inside with the barrel of the cowboy gun despite the muzzle at his back though ralph bales did not feel in danger maybe it was how the man was holding the gunwithout desperation more like a bottle of beer than a weapon maybe it was his eyes which were no longer as eerily serene as they had been they seemed more purposeful as if the man just wanted to talk in the rear of the warehouse was a small culdesac beneath a balcony it was very dark here lit only by indirect light filtering in from the huge arched windows covered with grime and dust the floor was dusty too but much of that had been disturbed by footprints directly in front of a bee gees poster was a woodandcanvas directors chair ralph bales stopped the beer man motioned him forward to the chair sit down he sat this place is pretty nifty you shooting your film here put these on each wrist the man handed him two pairs of handcuffs right first then hook it to the arm kinky ralph bales looked at them closely property of maddox pol dept was stamped on the side whered you get these put them on ralph bales relaxed further a guy like this an amateur was definitely not going to hurt a man handcuffed to a chair he clicked one pair of cuffs on his right wrist then to the chair then he locked the other cuff to his left wrist the beer man stepped forward slowly and with a ratcheting sound hooked the remaining cuff to the other arm of the chair he stepped back like a carpenter surveying a good flooring job he pulled the colt out of his belt now who was in the lincoln so he had a tape recorder hidden somewhere trying to get a confession what lincoln would that be who was it okay ralph bales said with amused frustration this is some kind of bullshit the man in the lincoln who i dont know what youre what did you come down to the federal building for ralph bales lifted his hands as far as he could the tiny chains clinked i wanted to talk to you is all what did you want to say to me okay i was going to pay you to keep quiet about what you saw but you had a gun in your pocket and only he squinted trying to remember forty bucks on you i was going to pay you a lot of moneymore than id want to carry around who was in the lincoln the beer man recited persistently i dont know i really dont sorry i wish youd be more cooperative the beer man said with disappointment and shot ralph bales squarely in the center of his stomach john pellam walked through the cloud of sulfury smoke and looked down not bleeding badly he announced ralph bales stared in terror at the wound his mouth was open why he whispered you shot me god that hurts who was in the car whyd you do that for whyd you do that who pellam asked evenly was in the lincoln my god ralph bales whispered gazing with shocked bewilderment at pellam im going to die if you dont tell me im going to shoot you again i dont pellam shot him again a huge explosion the bullet hit a few inches to the left of the first wound no no man stop ill tell you ralph bales jerked his head to flick sweat out of his eyes okay philip lombro now call a doctor whos he ralph bales did not hear please im going to bleed to death please philip lombro lombro whos he oh man im going to faint pellam cocked the gun who is he no no dont man not again hes some real estate guy dont do it again spell it spell what oh man his name lombro why did he want gaudia dead i dont know i didnt ask im going to faint oh shit some personal thing i swear to god he hired me to do it im bleeding to death where does he live i dont know man believe me i dont know in maddox somewhere his office is on main thats all i know hes in the phone book what do you want from me for christsake call a doctor with tearful sincerity he said im a good catholic pellam did not move for a minute he smiled no man no dont do it youre just going to leave me arent you dont let me die i told you what you wanted call the cops turn me in but for gods sake get me to a doctor would you testify against this lombro absolutely oh man you want it you got it pellam repeated the word softly absolutely he rubbed the gun with his left hand ralph bales was crying this seemed to irritate pellam he said theyre wax bullets ralph bales kept sobbing pellam said again petulantly would you stop crying theyre not real bullets what i wish youd stop that pellam said referring to the crying ralph bales slowly caught his breath he frowned he looked down at his gutat the two large splats of bright red blood as far as the handcuffs allowed he pulled his shirt apart there were huge reddish welts where the bullets had struck him but the skin was not broken fragments of white wax were bonded to the cloth which was stained with dark blood ralph bales began to cry again but they were tears from hysterical laughter you son of a bitch you goddamn that was when a shadow appeared on the floor beside the men the heads of both the men snapped sideways they saw sensible pumps a womans pants a denim jacket nina sassowers pale pretty face and the gun in her hand nina pellam called ralph bales began to relax pellam said what are you doing here her voice was distant as if she were speaking through layers of silk or gauze i thought youd come here you should leave whats that gun for thiss got nothing to do with you she stepped closer looking gaunt and pale her skin was matte and her eyes were two dark dots she looked at them both and her eyes quickly settled on ralph baless wounds oh god pellam he told her they were fake bullets then squinted as he noticed her concerned eyes gazing at the man in the chair do you know him he asked she turned to him im sorry pellam what do you he started toward her she quickly lifted the big colt toward his chest no stay where you are nina put it on the floor your gun put it down pellam did then he laughed bitterly it was all planned wasnt it it was all planned she whispered you picked me up at the hospital you had me get you a job so youd be close by who are you working for lombro or crimmins peterson who im sorry pellam im so sorry ralph bales said did phil send you oh man he moaned in relief come on honey get me out of here nina squinted almost closing her eyes pellam knew what this meant he leapt to the floor as the three jarring explosions from ninas automatic filled the room windows rattled and dust from the tin ceiling floated down around the three of them like gray snow the shadows of startled pigeons zipped across the windows twentyfour pellam slowly stood dizzy from both the fall and the pounding to his ears from the gunshots reluctantly he looked across the room ralph bales had taken all three rounds in the chest the chair had not toppled backwards but had turned fortyfive degrees sideways under the impact the man sat motionless head down facing the windows as if he were dozing in the weak sunlight nina carefully unchambered the next round and extracted the clip the empty gun the slide locked back went into her purse she then stooped and began to collect the spent cartridges from the floor with impatient but fastidious care as if she were picking up socks from her bedroom carpet before vacuuming pellam quickly uncuffed ralph baless wrists pocketed the cuffs and wiped the chair free from fingerprints he then hurried nina outside and into the car his fear of impending police was unwarranted however the gunshots had not been heard or if so had perhaps been attributed to the final scenes of missouri river blues they drove to a nearby park on the river bank you know where i got the gun nina whispered my father kept it in his upstairs desk drawer of our house she wiped her tearful eyes oh you should have seen that desk nina continued it was a rolltop oak i guess dark with those thin yellow streaks in it you unlocked it with a brass key that always needed polishing there was such a wonderful sound when the lock turned then youd lift up the top and there were dozens of these little compartments lined with green felt some of the compartments had some of them had she cried for a moment pellam made no gesture of comforting her some of the pigeonholes had little doors with knobs on them we would go searching for secret compartments we looked up under drawers we tapped the back with hammers listening for hollow spots we found the gun when we were children but we didnt think much of it it had been years since i thought of the desk then last week i remembered it i remembered the gun and i went over to my mothers and got it ive been practicing since then that brought back so many memories the two of us looking through the desk as little girls looking for toys for paper clips for the tears were strong now my sister and me your sister pellam said and finally he understood she was the woman with vincent gaudia the one who was killed that night nina said all the papers talked about was the cop who was shot and about gaudia nobody said anything about sally ann nobody cared about her the day after she was killed i stayed up all night trying to figure out how to find the man whod done it i thought id wait until the police caught him and then at the trial id shoot him but that might take months and maybe by then i wouldnt have the courage to do it so i decided to meet donnie i saw his wedding picture in the paper and it said he was in maddox general i planned to get to know him and see if he could tell me the killers name and you met me instead your mother wasnt really in the hospital no my sister was my only family she was the relative who died i told you about in the camper the funeralwhen we were looking for that field not my aunt thats why i started to cry you overheard donnie arguing with me you heard him say i knew who the killer was she nodded im sorry pellam there was sadness in her voice but contrition none at all why the job with the film company i knew hed be looking for you i thought sooner or later hed find you you had that gun with you all the while some of the time that was why she had been so upset when she was attacked at the factory she explained she hadnt had the gun with her then she regretted missing the chance the chance to shoot an fbi agent pellam didnt tell her this but her name wasnt the same as yours your sisters i mean no sally anns name was moore its her married name she was divorced a few years ago pellam was i wrong i mean think about itthe policeman was doing his job and he got hurt and gaudia was a terrible man and he got killed but all my sister did was go to dinner with him she was innocent pellam doubted whether going out with vince gaudia qualified you as a totally innocent human being but he didnt think nina was wrong at all to do what shed done why he himself had been wandering the barren streets of maddox with a gun for exactly the same reasonto get revenge for stile s death i wanted to kill him she said i didnt want him to just go to jail i had to do it myself pellam said nothing he leaned forward and put his arm around her he smelled the sour cordite in her hair from the gunsmoke he rocked his head against hers but this gesture was halfhearted pellams thoughts were elsewhere they drove up the street for a short ways until they found a pay phone pellam stopped climbed out of the car are you going to tell the police about me he looked at her for a long moment but said nothing her reaction was to pull down the cars visor flip it open and begin to brush her wispy blond hair pellam consulted a card in his wallet then dialed a number in a slightly accented voice a man said hello mr crimmins this is the friend that spoke to you last night pellam had called the man to tell him not to panic when he heard peterson announce an impending arrest ah well yes how are you fine you crimmins chuckled at the etiquette im great i assume thingsve worked out theres been a slight complication serious no not really thats good but i wonder if your associate mr stettles free to help me for about an hour i think that could be arranged tell him to meet me at the corner of main and fifteenth in downtown maddox in half an hour is this a possibly risky situation i dont think so but could you ask him if hed bring some garbage bags garbage bags hell understand they went to the lounge and meeting her there rather than in his room replaced the evening with nina as the best thing that had happened to donnie buffett for a year you shouldnt smoke he told wendy weiser as she lit her cigarette i know she inhaled three times and stubbed it out thats all i smoke anyway and just twice a day well three times he nodded at the lie and looked her over she was off duty today and had come in solely to meet with him she wore tight faded blue jeans and a leather jacket over a tshirt imprinted with a slogan he made her pull the jacket aside to reveal the words once i thought i was mistaken but i was wrong he liked her earrings a tiny gold fork hung from one lobe and a matching dinner knife from the other what was so good about the meeting was that he was no longer a prisoner or rather he was not the same degree of prisoner he had been in maximum security and now he had been upgraded to minimum it wasnt yet straight time but that was okay for the first time in almost two weeks he had a sense of motionbuffett moved past things rather than being the stationary object the breeze was stale and it smelled of antiseptic and steamtable food but it moved nonetheless and that was wonderful his maiden voyage in the wheelchair he had insisted on piloting himself and weiser hadnt objected though j she said it was against the rules he had a feeling that weiser knew what the hospital could do with their rules and probably told them so frequently buffett shoved off hard from the doorway of his room but his arms were stronger than expected and he had lost control caroming off a water cooler and a candy stripers backside before he got the feel of the chair they had wheeled and walked down the corridor buffett considering whether to tell weiser about the night with nina sassower it was the sort of thing that she probably ought to know it might help with his therapy but he kept mum he hardly wanted nina to get into trouble anyway if he didnt blow the whistle there was always the chance she might come back again he wondered if he could do it three times in one night the lounge consisted of a dozen formica tables bright blue and chipped against one orangepainted wall were old battered vending machines for coffee and hot chocolate for candy for soda some bulbs in the soda machine were burned out the front said oca ola she asked what he wanted buffett said hed have an oke laughing hard she said ill have an iet oke how come you got a great igure they laughed some more and she walked over to the snack machine she bought a pack of peanut butter crackers dinner she said and he almost asked her out thencasually thinking he would just wonder out loud if sometime shed like to grab a bite with him but the terror nuzzled him viciously and the opportunity to ask the question suddenly closed then she was at the table lighting inhaling on and stubbing out the cigarette he was slightly disappointed when she took a manila folder out of her attache case this made the meeting more professional less social she set it in front of her but did not open the file donnie youre out of spinal shock now there has been good restoration of sensation and control to many of your functions i think bladder and rectal control will be almost normal and as i told you theres no reason that i can see that sexual functioning wont ultimately be fine buffett was clamping down on the inside of his cheek to keep from smiling ultimately its clear now that the most serious and permanent damage will be to your legs there may be some improvement but most likely itll be along the line of faint response to external stimuli as far as walking again on your own well its the way i told you before donnie she offered him a cracker he shook his head she ate it then sipped the soft drink theres a lot of research going on now in this area most of its trying to isolate substancessome are like hormones and some are structural proteins he smiled to himself as he felt himself sinking into the brilliant quagmire of her brain that affect how the neurons reach and talk to their receptor cells donnie nodded and appeared he believed to be interested something called fns feminine he wanted to make a joke but his mind went blank functional neuromuscular stimulation her eyes sparkled as they always did when she spoke about science and she explained about some contraption that you hooked up to your leg muscles to send in jolts of electricity to stimulate them in a certain order eventually using this device you could propel yourself in a jerky fashion by using canes or a walker she kept talking but donnie buffett stopped listening he was deciding that whatever fns was exactly hed never get hooked up to anything like that buffett knew he could sit in a wheelchair for the rest of his ufe and maybe cry sometimes and maybe scream and he could see himself pitching a lamp through the tv set after watching jeopardy or wheel of fortune one too many times and he could picture himself wheeling out of the house and getting a job learning to do wheelies learning to go over curbs by himself developing huge ballbuster arms and a fiftyinch chest but no machines just like if he were blind he would use a cane but never rely on a dog he couldnt explain what this distinction was exactly but to him it was real and it was the difference between his heart being alive and being cold dead he noticed that weiser had stopped talking and it seemed as if she had asked him a question he didnt feel like asking her to repeat it he said would you go out with me he added i mean have dinner when she declined as he had somehow known she would it wasnt with a shocked or what would have been worse maternal smile she looked at him with the intrigued gaze of a married woman at a party propositioned discreetly by a man she finds attractive a pleasant regret not an astonished surprise she added we should stay friends you know and when she said that the terror nudged donnie buffett once hard bringing sweat to his forehead but then it curled up somewhere inside him and for the time being fell into a deep deep sleep twentyfive theres a man to see you sir he says his name is pellam pellam do i know him philip lombro said running a chamois over his bally shoes he knows you sir im busy take his card lombro sat back in his leather chair and stared at the floor dense clouds passing by outside would cast diffuse shadows on the green carpeting then a moment later the harsh sunlight would return the intercom clicked again and startled him the electric voice said he says it has to do with the late mr bales lombro cleared his throat send him in pellam walked into the office he looked around at the somber burgundy and navy booksbusiness books lawyer books the desk the pattern of cloud shadows on the verdant carpet the view out the window the smooth deco designs on the old brick building across the street pellam sat down uninvited in the chair directly opposite lombros your hit man is dead lombro swallowed and folded the square of chamois carefully yes it was him the one with the case of beer the man whod seen him youre the witness the witness pellam said the word slowly tasting it letting the sibilant draw out over his teeth mr james no its pellam lombro shook his head at this confused then he said cautiously you cheated me pellam frowned im sorry you took my money and you still went to the us attorney i heard the news conference what money the fifty thousand the money ralph gave you the voice faded and pellam obvioulsy came to the conclusion that was setting prominently into lombros mind they shared rueful smiles lombro said i see the quality of your hired help leaves a little bit to be desired so it seems hes dead you say an accident i see are you here to loll me this he asked in a matteroffact voice no pellam said i swear i forbade ralph to hurt you all he was going to do was pay you to but he came to the federal building yesterday with a gun you knew that lombros mouth closed and he touched some strands of silver hair at his temple i want to know why you had gaudia killed are you a policeman no but you have a microphone on you pellam took off his jacket and turned out the pockets of his shirt and jeans lombro eyes fixed on the grip of the colt in pellams waistband took the bomber jacket and felt through the pockets i just want to know pellam said sincerely lombro crossed his legs and gripped his ankle with his right hand rubbing his fingers along it he did not sort through his thoughts this was a story he had planned to tell for some time perhaps to his prosecutor i love my nieces like daughters ive never been married never had children have you pellam didnt answer one niece of mine was eighteen she was a sweet sweet girl but she was somewhat heavy unsure of herself she was going to school and working parttime as a waitress in a restaurant that vincent gaudia would sometimes eat in gaudia was a generous man with money he would give her twentydollar tips then it was a fiftydollar tip and after that it was the promise of a hundreddollar tip i suppose you can guess what happened they spent a few nights together and then gaudia simply forgot that she existed but the poor child believed shed fallen in love with him i tried to convince her otherwise but she was inconsolable he refused to take her calls and answer her letters finally she went to his home it was late at night after she got off work at the restaurant she left his house at two in the morning and on the way home drove through red light her car was hit by a truck and she was lolled she had been drinking and had had sex just an hour before the evidence indicated the sex was of a sort i choose not to describe one of the two thousand pellam mused im sorry ive heard gaudia had his share of women she was a conquest just so the police said the accident was her fault but of course it wasnt it was vincent gaudias he seduced my niece its as if he murdered her this is what gaudia did to my family and when my brother refused to do anything about his daughters death i decided to old world revenge if you will you knew that bales or his partner killed the woman who was with gaudia too they shot that cop and a friend of mine lombro shook his head there was alarm and sorrow in his face this has all gone so wrong so wrong i should have done the manly thing i should have lolled him myself and taken the consequences im not a coward i just didnt understand how these things worked have you called the police not yet no pellam said he looked around the office at the paneling the prints on the walls he asked whatre you worth pardon money you know how much do you have i dont really know a million pellam suggested lombro smiled more than that why are you asking pellam said what does that mean more than that i dont exactly know lombro said stridently youre in the real estate business lombro reached toward his knee and picked a piece of lint from his slacks and ive been in that line long enough to understand when an offer is about to be made you know pellam said they have this service in some states its called the crime victims reparation fund or something like that you ever hear about it no when someones mugged or raped they get some money somebody gets killed the family gets it and youre suggesting i pay you something pellam hesitated then he laughed yep exactly how much lombro opened his drawer then perhaps deciding a check might not be the way to handle something like this closed it again im thinking mostly of the policeman that got shot whatever how much did you have in mind hes paralyzed the cop hell never walk again lifes going to be pretty expensive for him housekeepers special cars and by the way i got fired thanks to you lombro looked up from his shoes which he now planted on the carpeting i am being very honest when i tell you that i didnt want you hurt and that i didnt want anyone to die except gaudia i hope you agree i had a well an honorable motive for doing what i did i dont think youll hurt me no pellam said i dont have any intention of hurting you you can of course go to the police and tell them what happened but what it really comes down to is my word against your word ive been involved in plenty of litigation lawyers call cases like this a liars match who believes whom i think i stand as good a chance of being believed as you do im influential in this town im one of the few businessmen still able to pay taxes which i do in great abundance im well known in the assessors office and in city hall too so although i sympathize with you and your friend you dont really have much leverage id consider ten thousand for each of you nope thats not enough pellam took a small cloth square from his pocket and dropped it on the desk take a look lombro unfolded the handkerchief and looked at the businesscard case inside he opened it up shrugged and dropped it back on the handkerchief pellam scooped the case up and put it in his pocket and who lombro asked is special agent gilbert hes the man buried in the foundation of one of the buildings youre putting up a project outside of st louis foxwood i get a kick out of those names for condominiums stonehenge windcrest do people really what theres no one buried in and sad to say hed been shot with a gun thats buried in your yard at home impossible i dont own a gun i didnt say you own a gun i just said the gun was buried on your property this is nonsense lombros silver face flushed and his eyes darted a distinguished man made common a powerful man impotent your policeman friend is he helping lombro stared at pellams jacket pocket he whispered and i just put my fingerprints on his id card didnt i not to say theyd convict you but agent gilbert was involved in the gaudia murder he threatened me and my friend pellam added and id feel obligated to being a personal acquaintance of the us attorney id feel it was my duty philip lombro looked out the window at the brick of the building across the way he glanced down licked his finger and lifted a fleck of paper or dust off the heel of one of his shoes black cherry tasseled ballys polished like dark mirrors pellam started to speak but didnt he paused staring at the shoes frowning as if hed seen them somewhere before but was unable to remember exactly where tony sloan was still not in general speaking to pellam using the strongest language pellam had ever heard him but he made an exception to explain that because the machine guns had been released and the ending of the film was successfully in the can half of pellams fee would be released the rest sloan was retaining to help defray the cost of the delay you want to play it that way tony then ill see you in court sloan had shrugged and taken up the vow of silence again returning to the editing van where close to five hundred thousand feet of film and an extremely discouraged editor awaited the arrival of the directors artistic vision pellam had gone directly downstairs to marriotts huck finn room to crash the wrap party there he drank sloans champagne and ate the catfish tidbits and hush puppies while he chatted with the cast and crew all of them exhausted from the trials of the final days of the shooting that they did not know or care if he was still an untouchable he looked over the crowd he saw the makeup artists in the corner nina sassower was not among them pellam wandered over to stace stacey as exhausted as anyone but still retaining his unflappable good spirits pellam handed over the unused wax bullets and the empty casings stace had loaned him pellam nodded at them wouldnt mention this stace pocketed the munitions and touched his lips with a forefinger pellam told him about sloans holding back his fee now on his third or fourth cuba libre stace was pretty loose trying to squeeze you is he that man is a hundred percent son of a bitch the arms master said using the strongest language pellam had ever heard him utter but youll work with him again oh you betcha and youll be in line right behind me probably pellam said a woman appeared in the doorway of the banquet room pellam recognized her as one of sloans secretaries she urgently waved a slip of paper at him he wondered if sloan had changed his mind and was reluctantly releasing the rest of the money not that it truly mattered fifty thousand dollars had just been transferred from philip lombros investment company into pellams account at a bank in sherman oaks you got this fax john its from marty weller in budapest and was apparently just about to be transferred out again to finance central standard time she handed it to him and headed back toward a cluster of actors but got no farther than stace stacey who encircled her waist and rose on tiptoe to whisper something in her ear she giggled pellam unfolded the fax it took a whole page of producerbabble for marty weller to break the news to him that tristar was going to be picking up paramounts fallen standard and financing the terrorist script which weller would be producing in lieu of central standard time the hungarians were going to tristar with him they asked weller to say hello to pellam whom they felt they knew already and whom they had dubbed the american auteur they hoped that perhaps in the future they all might work together on a cleverscripted hey knockemdead cult film noir project pellam folded the paper and slipped it into his back pocket he lifted another champagne off a passing tray he closed his eyes and rubbed the cold flute over his forehead stace returned a moment later he was without the secretary but the expression on the arms masters face was not that of a rejected man he smiled agreeably and said to pellam tomorrow morning lets you and me go shooting what do you say well take the charter arms and the dan wesson and shoot up some cans maybe they even have rattlesnakes around here pellam opened his mouth to make excuses but then he said as long as i dont have to get up too early stace oh no sir films over were on vacation now the basketball court on leonard street in maddox is closed most of the time its part of a school playground but because of budget cutbacks the department of education cant afford to keep it open when schools not in session and the gate is locked at pm not that it matters much the local kids have pried apart enough chain link gate to slip through for pickup games any time they want the court is asphalt theres a lot of graffiti on the brick walls surrounding itnames of kids and gangs and some of those flashy threedimensional block letters and drawings that the talented punks do but the asphalt itself is clean as black marble in a church nobody messes with foul lines tonight a mild humid night in december two men are at the fence the opening in the gate would be big enough for them to pass through if one of the men werent in a wheelchair its a small chair gunmetal blue and sporty with wheels tilted at the top theyre closer together than at the bottom the man who is standing looks around and takes a geared carbontempered bolt cutter from a large cylindrical canvas sports bag he props one long handle on his hip and using both hands on the other handle severs one side of a link of chain then the other they enter the court the man in the chair speeds forward under the thrusts of his powerful arms which are dark with hair pellam says go easy with an old man huh it takes a while for donnie buffett to get used to dribbling but hes played good offense for years and knows how to keep the ball away from his body while controlling it he does have a problem though because he can only coast in for a shot if he uses his arm to move forward he goes in circles what he does is he sets the ball on his lap and speeds in for the layup pellam whistles loudly through his teeth and cries traveling so whatre you back in town for buffett asks him after sinking the shot that missouri river movie nope thats in post production now july release date im suing the director for my fee and credit thats a hassle goes with the territory i just came back to do some scouring for another script whats this one called central standard time sounds boring whos going to be in it you should cast geena davis i really like her or shelley long you ever watch cheers nobodys in it nobodys even making it yet when i was here i saw some locations that looked pretty good i wanted to check them out this time of year thats when the story takes place winter thats pretty wild two movies in one year maybe maddoxll be the new hollywood hollywood started out as a desert pellam tells him how long you here for a week or two then im heading on to my mothers place upstate new york for the holidays buffett usually makes his shots which pellam finds extremely frustrating pellam has been watching the lakers all season he tries to fly up to the basket and stuff the ball in but he comes nowhere close he is a terrible player the nokona cowboy boots dont help much buffett gets the rebound away from pellam and sinks another hell with this pellam says lets see a slamdunk they play for a half hour and take a break for beer in response to a question buffett tells pellam he isnt seeing nina anymore thats over with it was just a fluke thing i never knew what to make of her she was moody a lot it was like she had some big secret or something i picked that up too pellam wipes his mouth with his sleeve and thinks theyre crazy to be drinking beer in december and crazy to be playing basketball now too did i tell you buffett asks what pennys moved out were getting a divorce youre going to what a divorce get one god pellam says well i think thats awful buffett looks away inordinately embarrassed and swallows a lot of beer it happens did she find out about nina no she still doesnt know pellam shakes his head and starts to wave his arm at buffetts legs but changes the motion to encompass the entire court all this and she decides to leave you no pellam uhuh im the one getting the divorce its my idea shes going to live with her parents oh this too pellam thinks is crazy he looks at buffett for a moment all this and you leave her yep why you were over to the house you really have to ask but youll be living by yourself a time like this buffett shrugs i guess yeah pellam gives him a morepowertoyou shrug and practices dribbling the ball gets away from him he hops in front and stops it then asks you see dr wendy lately thother day so nothing new same old prognosis you want to talk about it no they drink beer for a few minutes talking about the knicks and the lakers then buffett says theyve tried these new drugs on me they dont have any effect you gonna kill yourself i dont think so someday maybe buffett is neither joking nor serious when he says this i just thought of something you play poker buffett laughs at the idiocy of the question of course i play poker you like chili no i hate chili a breeze comes up and its too cold to sit still and drink beer so they head back toward the basket and begin to play again pellam comes up fast and gets the ball away from buffett he dribbles fiercely and lobs a long one a threepointer which he knows isnt going to go in but it hits the rim reverberates backand forth madly and finally drops through the rusty metal hoop into buffetts waiting hands about the author jeffery deavers novels have appeared on a number of bestseller lists around the world including the new fork times the london
